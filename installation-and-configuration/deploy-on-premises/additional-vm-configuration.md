# Additional Virtual Machine Configuration

After the Virtual Machine has been created by your **Infrastructure team** some **additional configuration steps are needed before you install SysKit Point** to that machine. Connect to the virtual machine using an **RDP connection** and perform the following steps:

* **Prepare a Service Account** - **windows account** to run the **SysKit Point windows service**
* **Configure Windows Firewall** - need to allow access to the SysKit Point web application
* **Configure Internet Options** - required to **enable login to Office 365** from the **Point Configuration Wizard**
* **Install a Compatible Browser** - needed **after** Point setup to access the **Point web application**

## Service Account

A Service account is a **Windows Account** used to run the **SysKit Point windows service**. This windows service will **host the Point web application**.

We recommend you use one of the following options for the service account:

* Create a dedicated domain account: `Domain\PointServiceAccount`
* Create a local computer account: `Virtual_Machine_Name\PointServiceAccount`
* Use your own account \(the same one you use for RDP connection\): `Domain\Username`
  * Please note each time your **password expires SysKit Point windows service will stop** until you update it

The service account needs the following privileges:

* **Local Administrator** role on the **Virtual Machine**.
* **db owner** role on the **SysKit Point SQL database** if you setup the database connection to use windows authentication \(Recommended\)

Please note: This account is **not used** to authenticate against Office 365 and does **not need** any Office 365 roles.

## Configure Windows Firewall

To be able to use the SysKit Point application from **outside the local virtual machine** you need to be able to reach the page where the Point web application is hosted.

To allow inbound traffic on the Virtual Machine, follow these steps:

* **Use RDP connection to connect to Virtual Machine**
* **Open Windows Firewall with Advanced Security**
* **Select Inbound Rules \(1\)**
* **Click New Rule action \(2\)**
* New **Inbound Rule Wizard** opens that enables you to create an inbound rule for **TCP protocol** on **port 443**.

## Configure Internet Explorer Settings

SysKit Point uses **modern authentication** to enable **single sign-on** with your **Office 365 account** to the Point web application. **During the SysKit Point configuration** process **Global administrator** will be asked to **login** and **provide consent**. For this login experience Point uses an integrated version of the **Internet Explorer** browser. **Additional configuration of Internet Explorer is needed** in order to be able to sign in to [**Office.com**](https://www.office.com/).

**Enable Access to Microsoft Pages**

Server versions of Windows \(Internet Explorer\) use an enhanced security settings and in order to be able to use single sign-on authentication it is necessary to enable access to the [**Microsoft login page**](https://login.microsoft.com).

We recommend configuring IE settings the following way:

* Open **Internet Explorer**
* Select **Tools** &gt; **Internet Options** &gt; **Security tab**
* Select **Trusted sites** icon &gt; **Sites** button
* Add following Microsoft addresses to trusted sites list:

  [\*.microsoft.com](additional-vm-configuration.md), [\*.live.com](additional-vm-configuration.md), [\*.microsoftonline.com](additional-vm-configuration.md)

**Enable JavaScript**

Microsoftâ€™s login window uses JavaScript to render its content. For it to work it is necessary to enable scripting in Internet Explorer settings. To enable it, follow the steps:

* Open **Internet Explorer**
* Select **Tools** &gt; **Internet Options** &gt; **Security tab \(1\)**
* Click the **Custom Level...** button **\(2\)**
* Scroll down and change the **Active Scripting setting** &gt; select the **Enable** option **\(3\)**
* **Confirm** the change
* Close **Internet Options**

## Install a Compatible Browser

We are always trying to give our users the best security and visual experience while using our application and in order to provide that we are **not compatible with Internet Explorer** and you should **install a compatible browser** to be able to use SysKit Point. After configuration, SysKit Point users will be able to access the SysKit Point interface from any [supported internet browser](../../requirements/system-requirements.md#supported-browsers) through the specified web application URL.

## Output

When you finish the above steps, you will need the following information for the next steps in the installation process:

* **Service account** to run the SysKit Point windows service
