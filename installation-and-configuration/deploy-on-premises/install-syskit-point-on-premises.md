## Installation Steps

1. [Download the SysKit Point setup file](https://my.syskit.com/).
2. Unpack and run the setup file - **SysKitPointSetup.exe**. The wizard will guide you through the installation steps.
3. Check the **I Accept the terms of the license agreement** option to accept the [EULA](https://www.syskit.com/eula/) and click **Next &gt;** to proceed.
4. By default, the installation folder is set to **C:\Program Files\SysKit\Point**. You can modify it by clicking the **Change** button. Once selected, click **Next &gt;** to proceed. 
5. By default, the **Run Configuration Wizard now** option is selected. **SysKit Point Configuration Wizard** will, therefore, automatically start when you click the **Finish** button. Alternatively, you can always start the Configuration Wizard manually by running it from the installation folder. The default location is: **C:\ProgramFiles\SysKit\Point\Host\Configuration.exe**.
