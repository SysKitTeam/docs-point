3. Check the **I Accept the terms of the license agreement** option to accept the [EULA](https://www.syskit.com/eula/) and click **Next &gt;** to proceed.
4. By default, the installation folder is set to **C:\Program Files\SysKit\Point**. You can modify it by clicking the **Change** button. Once selected, click **Next &gt;** to proceed.
