# Prerequisites

When deploying SysKit Point on-premises, two necessary components are required:

* [**Windows Server**](syskit-point-server.md) where SysKit Point will be installed
* [**SQL database**](syskit-point-database.md) where SysKit Point will store its data 

Click on the appropriate link to learn more about requirements for each of the mentioned resources.

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Requirements highly depend on the Office 365 activity, the number of users, and the amount of data in your environment.** The larger the environment, the more resources will be required to run SysKit Point smoothly.
{% endhint %}

If you run into any issues when preparing your environment, please [contact us](https://www.syskit.com/contact-us/).
