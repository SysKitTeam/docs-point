  environment.

# Permission Requirements

To successfully install and configure SysKit Point, various permissions need to be granted by the following administrator roles in your environment:

* **Azure administrator**
* **Azure SQL administrator**
* **Office 365 Global administrator**

Let's take a look at each of them in more detail.

## Azure administrator

When deploying SysKit Point to an Azure environment, we can distinguish between two main user accounts in Azure Active Directory:

* **User installing SysKit Point**
* **Service account running SysKit Point Service**

Each of the user accounts needs to have proper privileges to:

* **Complete SysKit Point installation and configuration**
* **Run SysKit Point Service** and thus collect Office 365 data

### User Installing SysKit Point

**User installing SysKit Point** needs to be granted the following privilege on the Azure Virtual Machine where SysKit Point will be installed:

* **Local Administrator** 

{% hint style="warning" %}
Once installed, SysKit Point web-app can be accessed and used with a non-privileged user account.
{% endhint %}

### Service Account

A [service account](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/identity-protection/access-control/service-accounts) is a user account that is created explicitly to provide a security context for Services running on Windows Server operating systems. The security context determined the Serviceâ€™s ability to access local and network resources. The Windows operating systems rely on Services to run various features. These Services can be configured through the applications, the Services snap-in, or Task Manager, or by using Windows PowerShell.

**The Service account used to run SysKit Point Service needs to have the following privileges** to be able to [collect Office 365 data](../../how-to/collect-office-365-data.md) and run other associated jobs:

* **local administrator** privileges on the Azure Virtual Machine with UAC control disabled so that we can verify your credentials
* **db\_owner** privileges on the created SysKit Point dedicated Azure SQL database
* **log on as Service** rights configured

{% hint style="info" %}
If the service account is outside your domain the account name must be typed in the down-level logon name format: **domain\accountname**
{% endhint %}

## Azure SQL Administrator

After SysKit Point is installed on an Azure Virtual Machine, SysKit Point Configuration Wizard will require a connection to an Azure SQL database.

**Azure SQL Administrator** should ensure the following is met:

* **SysKit Point dedicated Azure SQL database is created**
* **User account running the configuration wizard has db\_owner rights on Azure SQL database**
* **SysKit Point Service account has db\_owner rights on Azure SQL database**

## Office 365 Global Administrator

**When connecting to an Office 365 tenant** during the configuration process, **you need to connect with a Global Administrator account.**

**The first time you connect to your Office 365 tenant, you will be prompted to consent** to a set of permissions that SysKit Point requires to function correctly. Additional prompts may show up in the future when installing a newer version of SysKit Point because of new functionality, and in consequence, potentially new required permissions.
