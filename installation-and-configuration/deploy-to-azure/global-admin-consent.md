# Office 365 Global Administrator Consent

**When connecting to an Office 365 tenant** during the configuration process, **you need to connect with a Global Administrator account.**

**The first time you connect to your Office 365 tenant, you will be prompted to consent** to a set of permissions that SysKit Point requires to function correctly. Additional prompts may show up in the future when installing a newer version of SysKit Point because of new functionality, and in consequence, potentially new required permissions.

For a complete overview of individual permissions used by SysKit Point, please refer to the [following article](../../requirements/permission-requirements.md#syskit-point-app-permissions).
