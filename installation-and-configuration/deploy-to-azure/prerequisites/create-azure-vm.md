# Azure Virtual Machine

We recommend installing SysKit Point on a Windows Server machine to allow SysKit Point Service to crawl your Office 365 environment continuously. When choosing the Virtual machine image, please note the following:

* **Windows Server 2012 or newer is required** 
* **Microsoft .NET Framework 4.5 or higher is required**

After you create an Azure Virtual Machine, ensure the following:

* **Network Security Group is assigned to the Azure Virtual Machine**
* **Public IP address \(static\) is set for the Azure Virtual Machine** 

## Requirements per Subscription Plan

Based on the size of your Office 365 environment, SysKit Point comes with three different subscription plans:
* **Professional**
* **Team**
* **Enterprise**

## Permission Requirements

### User Installing SysKit Point

**User installing SysKit Point** needs to be granted the following privilege on the Azure Virtual Machine where SysKit Point will be installed:

* **Local Administrator** 

{% hint style="warning" %}
Once installed, SysKit Point web-app can be accessed and used with a non-privileged user account.
{% endhint %}

### Service Account

A [service account](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/identity-protection/access-control/service-accounts) is a user account that is created explicitly to provide a security context for Services running on Windows Server operating systems. The security context determined the Serviceâ€™s ability to access local and network resources. The Windows operating systems rely on Services to run various features. These Services can be configured through the applications, the Services snap-in, or Task Manager, or by using Windows PowerShell.

**The Service account used to run SysKit Point Service needs to have the following privileges** to be able to [collect Office 365 data](../../how-to/collect-office-365-data.md) and run other associated jobs:

* **local administrator** privileges on the Azure Virtual Machine with UAC control disabled so that we can verify your credentials
* **db\_owner** privileges on the created SysKit Point dedicated Azure SQL database
* **log on as Service** rights configured

{% hint style="info" %}
If the service account is outside your domain the account name must be typed in the down-level logon name format: **domain\accountname**
{% endhint %}

## Office 365 Global Administrator

**When connecting to an Office 365 tenant** during the configuration process, **you need to connect with a Global Administrator account.**

**The first time you connect to your Office 365 tenant, you will be prompted to consent** to a set of permissions that SysKit Point requires to function correctly. Additional prompts may show up in the future when installing a newer version of SysKit Point because of new functionality, and in consequence, potentially new required permissions.
