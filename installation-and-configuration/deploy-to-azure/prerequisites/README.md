# Prerequisites

When deploying SysKit Point in the Azure cloud environment, two necessary components are required:

* **[Azure Virtual Machine](create-azure-vm.md)** where SysKit Point will be installed
* **[Azure SQL database](create-azure-sql-database.md)** where SysKit Point will store its data 

Click on the appropriate link to learn more about requirements for each of the mentioned resources. 

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Requirements highly depend on the Office 365 activity, the number of users, and the amount of data in your environment.** The larger the environment, the more resources will be required to run SysKit Point smoothly.
{% endhint %}
