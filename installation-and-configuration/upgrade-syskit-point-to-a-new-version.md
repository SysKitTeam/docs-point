# Upgrade SysKit Point

Since **SysKit Point** is frequently getting new features, we highly recommend having the latest available version installed, to use its maximum potential. 

## Checking for Updates

**SysKit Point automatically checks for updates** every day, outside of working hours. **In case a new update is available, every SysKit Point user** **receives a popup message** at the bottom of the Home screen when they open the web application.

The **Read What's New** link opens a new tab in your browser at the [Product Updates](../product-updates/) section in SysKit Point documentation, where you can find out about new features, improvements, and bug fixes by each product version.

**If you activated SysKit Point**, clicking the **Download Latest Version** link will redirect you to the [Customers Portal](https://my.syskit.com/) page. From there, download the latest SysKit Point version available. In case you are using a **trial version** of SysKit Point, the same link will redirect you to the **SysKit Point web download page**.
