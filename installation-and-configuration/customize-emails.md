# Customize E-mails

SysKit Point **allows you to edit e-mails** that will be **sent to site owners** regarding features like **Permissions Review and Lifecycle Management**.

Customization can include changes to the subject, logo, and additional message in the body of the e-mail.

These changes can be performed in three locations within SysKit Point Settings:

* **General Settings &gt; E-mail section** 
* **Governance Settings &gt; Permissions Review** 
* **Governance Settings &gt; Lifecycle Management**

**Please note!**                                                                                                                             Customizing e-mail options are only available for the SysKit Point Enterprise [license](https://app.gitbook.com/@syskit/s/point-staging/~/drafts/-MCrLPR9x9lbJ9koNNIM/activation/activate-syskit-point).
{% endhint %}

## Settings &gt; E-mail section

In E-mail settings, you can only define which global logo would be used in e-mails that are being sent to site owners.

Regardless of which sending method you selected - [Exchange Online](https://app.gitbook.com/@syskit/s/point-staging/installation-and-configuration/enable-permissions-review#exchange-online-settings) or [SMTP](https://app.gitbook.com/@syskit/s/point-staging/~/drafts/-MCqXxgO525Wxs2xDP84/installation-and-configuration/enable-permissions-review#smtp-settings), you can enter your logo by providing a URL that is located in the **content distribution network** \(**CDN**\).

After entering the URL and clicking on the empty white space on the screen, a logo will appear. Click save to apply changes.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Hint!**                                                                                                                                               Modifying logo within SysKit Point is global action which means that editing on any location of the settings \(E-mail section, Permissions Review, and Lifecycle Management\) is correlated.
{% endhint %}

In the picture below, you can see the uploaded logo.
