# Customize E-mails

SysKit Point **allows you to edit e-mails** that will be **sent to site owners** regarding features like **Permissions Review and Lifecycle Management**.

Customization can include changes to the subject, logo, and additional message in the body of the e-mail.

These changes can be performed in three locations within SysKit Point Settings:

* **General Settings &gt; E-mail section** 
* **Governance Settings &gt; Permissions Review** 
* **Governance Settings &gt; Lifecycle Management**

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Please note!**                                                                                                                             Customizing e-mail options are only available for the **SysKit Point Enterprise** [**license**](https://app.gitbook.com/@syskit/s/point-staging/~/drafts/-MCrLPR9x9lbJ9koNNIM/activation/activate-syskit-point).
{% endhint %}

## Settings &gt; E-mail section

In E-mail settings, you can only define which global logo would be used in e-mails that are being sent to site owners.

Regardless of which sending method you selected - [Exchange Online](https://app.gitbook.com/@syskit/s/point-staging/installation-and-configuration/enable-permissions-review#exchange-online-settings) or [SMTP](https://app.gitbook.com/@syskit/s/point-staging/~/drafts/-MCqXxgO525Wxs2xDP84/installation-and-configuration/enable-permissions-review#smtp-settings), you can enter your logo by providing a URL that is located in the **content distribution network** \(**CDN**\).

After entering the URL and clicking on the empty white space on the screen, a logo will appear. Click save to apply changes.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Hint!**                                                                                                                                               Modifying logo within SysKit Point is global action which means that editing on any location of the settings \(E-mail section, Permissions Review, and Lifecycle Management\) is correlated.
{% endhint %}

In the picture below, you can see the uploaded logo.

If you wish to remove the logo, you can click on the action **Remove Logo** and save changes.

## Settings &gt; Permissions Review

To customize e-mail for the Permissions review, first, you have to enable the feature. For more information visit this [article](https://app.gitbook.com/@syskit/s/point-staging/~/drafts/-MCrRqc4CfI6LOglzRkJ/installation-and-configuration/enable-permissions-review).

Open the Permissions Review tab in the Governance section. Click on **Customize e-mail** button to open the editing screen.

There you will see a few sections such as subject, logo, banner image, and custom message.

You can change the subject of the mail for your coworkers for better communication.

The logo is also adjustable as mentioned earlier in the E-mail Settings section.

**Banner image** shown on the screen is a default SysKit image sent in our e-mails that are dedicated to site owners included in the Permissions Review process. For removing this image click on **Remove image** action below the image.

Regarding the custom message, it can contain plain text or HTML. A link has to be defined by HTML form **&lt;a href="link URL"&gt;text for the link&lt;/a&gt;** where instead of link URL you have to enter the actual desired URL, and instead of text for the link you have to enter some wanted words.

When you are done with editing the appearance of the Permissions Review e-mail, click the **Confirm button** to save the changes.

You can immediately see the e-mail changes if you open the **Preview e-mail screen**.

## Settings &gt; Lifecycle Management

Similar to the Permissions Review e-mail customization, there is one for the Lifecycle Management e-mails.

Open the **Customize e-mail** screen for editing.

![Lifecycle Management Settings screen](../.gitbook/assets/customize-e-mail_lifecycle-management-settings-screen.png)

You can see that the three subjects are changeable - subject, logo, and custom message.

![Customize Lifecycle Management E-mail screen](../.gitbook/assets/customize-e-mail_cuatomize-lifecycle-management-e-mail-screen.png)

All the rules are the same as for the Permissions Review e-mail customization regarding the type of date for the subject, custom message, and the logo.

You can see how the real e-mail would look like at the **Preview e-mail** screen. The button is located right next to the Customize e-mail button.
