# SysKit Point

Deep visibility, powerful management, and automated governance – gain it all with a single scalable platform for Microsoft 365. Here you will find everything you need to set up SysKit Point and learn about features.&#x20;



**DISCOVER**&#x20;

**Save hours of manual work and gain visibility with a centralized inventory:** users, structure, sharing, and resources across Microsoft Teams, Groups, OneDrive, SharePoint sites, and Power BI.&#x20;

Focus less on exploring, **be efficient**, and provide a better and safer collaboration experience. \


&#x20;**SECURE**&#x20;

Understand and **manage who has access to what** and **stay on top of unauthorized or malicious activity** by auditing internal and external users’ and admins’ actions.&#x20;

Take necessary actions to **prevent security problems and data leaks**, stay compliant with regulations, and keep the data secured in your environment. \


**CONTROL**&#x20;

**Automate governance** procedures, **avoid uncontrolled sprawl, and manage workspaces lifecycle**, from its creation to end of life.&#x20;

With SysKit Point governance features and Point Teams app, **end users increase productivity, get simplified processes, and reduce dependency on the support** team to manage access and create workspaces. **Admins get the platform that helps them support** **adoption** of modern ways of cloud collaboration, **keeping the data secured and controlling** everything with policies applied in the background.&#x20;
