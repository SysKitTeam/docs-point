## Syskit Point helps you...

**DISCOVER**

**Save hours of manual work and gain visibility with a centralized inventory:** users, structure, sharing, and workspaces across Microsoft Teams, Groups, OneDrive, SharePoint sites, and Power BI.

Focus less on exploring, **be efficient**, and provide a better and safer collaboration experience.

**SECURE**

Understand and **manage who has access to what** and **stay on top of unauthorized or malicious activity** by auditing internal and external users’ and admins’ actions.

Take necessary actions to **prevent security problems and data leaks**, stay compliant with regulations, and keep the data secured in your environment.

**CONTROL**

**Automate governance** procedures, **avoid uncontrolled sprawl, and manage workspaces lifecycle**, from its creation to end of life.

With Syskit Point governance features and Point Teams app, **end users increase productivity, get simplified processes, and reduce dependency on the support** team to manage access and create workspaces. **Admins get the platform that helps them support adoption** of modern ways of cloud collaboration, **keeping the data secured and controlling** everything with policies applied in the background.
