## Improvements & Bug Fixes

* **Improvements made to the Copilot Readiness tile.**
  * **Sensitive files** checks have been added to the tile, showing the total number of sensitive content shared **Company-wide** or **Shared with anyone**. 
    * **Sensitive Content Shared Anonymously** - this report can be generated by **clicking the number showing the amount of sensitive content** shared with anyone, located under the Shared with Anyone section of the tile.
    * **Sensitive Content in Private Workspaces Shared Company-Wide** - this report can be generated by **clicking the number showing the amount of sensitive content** in private workspaces shared company-wide and is located under the Company-wide section of the tile.

* **Improvements made to Reports.**
  * **The Sensitivity Label filter** was added when generating the **Permissions Matrix**, **Externally Shared Content** and **Group Access** reports.
    * You can choose for the report to show files with any sensitivity label or no sensitivity label, as well as generate it for specific sensitivity labels. 
    * Selecting a specific sensitivity label generates the report only for files with that specific label sensitivity applied.
    * You can also select the Sensitivity Labels column from the column chooser. 
  * **The Sharing Links report** has new columns available to select from the column chooser:
    * **Sign-in** - shows whether this user is allowed to sign in or has been blocked.
    * **Deleted** - shows whether the user was deleted or not
    * **Last Logged In** - shows the last log-in date for the user
  * **Custom Metadata columns were added** to the **User Access** and **Users with Privileged Access** reports.
  * **The Department column was added** to the **Users with Privileged Access** report and can be selected from the column chooser.

* **New column added to the Settings for Custom Metadata.**
  * **The Editing Allowed column** provides information on whether owners can manage this metadata through actions on the Sites or Teams & Groups overview screen or as a part of the Metadata Review task. 
  * If **editing is allowed**, a **green check** is shown in the column. 

* **Improved the sync process** to ensure that if the last sync was not executed successfully, the next sync that Syskit Point performs is a full sync instead of a partial.

* **The subject line** for policy vulnerability e-mails has been changed to reflect that there is an **Action Required**.

* **Fixed a bug** that did not include users that are both Microsoft Team Owners and Private Channel Owners as reviewers when performing the Access Review.

* **Fixed an issue** where Team Owners and Channel Primary Admins were incorrectly receiving Access Review e-mails and tasks for Private Channels instead of designated Channel Owners. 

* **Fixed a bug** that caused the Metadata Review screen to open after clicking the Request Access Review button on a workspace. 

* **Fixed an issue** that caused the Chat button to overlap with the expand icon in the right corner of reports.

* **Fixed an issue** that caused Yammer provisioning to fail and not include the defined owners and members in the provisioned workspace. 

* **Various improvements and minor UX and UI fixes are available**.
