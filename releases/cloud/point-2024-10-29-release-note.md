## Improvements & Bug Fixes

* **Improvements made to Completed Metadata Tasks.**
  * **By clicking a workspace** on the completed Metadata Review overview screen, **you are taken to the Review - Summary**.
    * On the Review - Summary screen, you can see the actions taken for this workspace, who the action was performed by and when, and any comments the reviewer left when resolving the task. Â 

* **When Provisioning a workspace**, you can now also copy the Site Theme. 
  * The **Site Theme can be copied** by selecting the following options:
    * Copy Team SharePoint Site - **Structure**
    * Copy Team SharePoint Site - **Structure & Content**
  * **Only the Site Theme is copied**, which means the header, navigation, or other aspects of **the site's look are not copied**.

* **Fixed an issue** that caused sensitivity labels not to apply properly when provisioning a workspace.

* **Various improvements, including UX and UI fixes, are available**.
