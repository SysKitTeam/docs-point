## Improvements & Bug Fixes 

* **Yammer is now Viva Engage.**
  * Yammer was renamed and the icons were changed to reflect the Microsoft 365 branding.

* **Fixed an issue** that caused the Swagger documentation to show the wrong domain name. 
  * In some instances, if a request was sent with a custom header, the domain shown in the Swagger documentation was replaced with an incorrect one or cached.

* **Fixed an issue** where ownership policies in provisioning templates weren't enforced during workspace requests. 
  * Despite the template settings, requests could previously be submitted without meeting the required number of owners or selecting a Primary Admin; this was now fixed, and requests cannot be sent without complying with ownership policies. 

* **Various improvements, including UX and UI fixes, are available.**
