## Improvements & Bug Fixes

* **New columns added to the Sites Overview screen**: **Number of Owners** and **Number of Admins**.
  * **Number of Owners** 
    * For Teams and M365 groups, this is the number of defined M365 group owners.
    * For SharePoint sites, the column shows the number of users in the **Owners SharePoint group** associated with the SharePoint site.
  * **Number of Admins** column shows the total number of users within the Site admins group. The Primary owner is counted here as well.
  * You can find and enable these columns from the Column Chooser.

* **New columns added** to the Sharing Links report: **Last Used** and **Last Used By**. 
  * These columns show the last time the content was accessed via a sharing link and who accessed it.
  * **Please note** that the added columns currently do not display data for OneDrive sharing links.

* **Various improvements, including UX and UI fixes, are available.**
