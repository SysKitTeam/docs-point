## Improvements & Bug Fixes

* **Improvements made to the Syskit Point app for Microsoft Teams**. 
  * The Requests screen now has default sorting and **the Requested On column** is automatically sorted in descending order, displaying the most recent requests at the top.
  * **Fixed a bug** that caused the app to show incorrect users as Approvers (Active and Resolved) in **the Sent To column**. 

* **Fixed an issue** where adding users when Resolving Access Requests for Exchange Groups (mail-enabled security groups & distribution lists) did not update the members list until the next sync.
  * Now, the change is immediately applied, and after refreshing the workspace, the added users can be found in the members list.

* **Extension Attributes** were added to the Users Overview report.
  * Additional properties (extension attributes) tied to users in Azure AD are now stored and can be seen on the Users Overview report. 

* **When creating a Provisioning Template**, you can now select Inactive Workspaces from the list of available policies.

* **Fixed a bug** that made the Request Review action visible for Collaborators on the Access Reviews report. 



* **Fixed an issue** where editing Provisioning templates resulted in the site picker loading indefinitely when copying content or structure from an archived or deleted workspace. 
  * Error messages have also been improved to better handle and explain such scenarios. 

* **Various improvements, including UX and UI fixes, are available**.
