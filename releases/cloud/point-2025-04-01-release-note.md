## Improvements & Bug Fixes 

* **Syskit Point now automatically assigns tasks to Syskit Point Admins** if a defined fallback user is no longer active.
  * **For example**, a fallback user can be defined when a user doesn't have a manager. Still, the specified user can be deleted or blocked from his sign-in. Â In that case, Syskit Point admins will be assigned to unresolved tasks to ensure task completion.

* **Fixed an issue** that caused the export action to not work on the Manage Reviewers screen. 

* **Fixed an issue** where the service account was erroneously removed from being Site Admin when applying a sensitivity label or applying the versioning limit policy via rule. 
  * The service account will no longer be removed if it is set as Site Admin before running the actions.

* **Various improvements, including UX and UI fixes, are available.**
