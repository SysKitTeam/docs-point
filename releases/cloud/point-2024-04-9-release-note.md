## Improvements & Bug Fixes

* **Planner activity detection added to workspaces!**
  * You can find the **Planner Activity column on the Inactive Workspaces report**, and it shows the last Planner activity for any inactive workspaces. 
  * **When determining whether a workspace is inactive in the Lifecycle Management** automation feature, the Planner activity is taken into account, so if there is Planner activity in a workspace, it is not considered inactive.

* **The Add Owners/Members action** now allows you to add a user just as an owner without adding them to the group as a member.

* **The Shadow users policy** can now only be applied to Teams, Groups, and Yammer workspaces.
  * All users who have permissions on a site but are not part of the Members or Owners group of that workspace are now considered Shadow Users.

* **Improved the Provisioning feature** in Syskit Point.
  * **Fixed an issue** that caused localization errors when trying to create a new SharePoint template from the Provisioning feature in Syskit Point.
  * **Fixed an issue** that prevented editing existing Provisioning templates.

* **Fixed an issue** with GCC High environments using the People Picker for the Syskit Point Teams App.

* **Fixed a bug** that caused the Power BI Workspaces and Inventory reports to show the wrong name for Personal Workspaces. 

* **Various improvements and minor UX and UI fixes are available**.
