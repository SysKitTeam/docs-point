* **Syskit Point 20203.4 comes with a new Look and feel and a revamped homepage experience!**
 We're excited to introduce the new look and feel of Syskit Point following our company rebranding. With improved platform capabilities and a redefined product vision as the central hub for administration, security, and compliance, we are thrilled to unveil the new homepage experience. This revamped interface features a left-hand menu and a centralized dashboard, offering a comprehensive overview of your Microsoft 365. Easily navigate and delve into specifics as needed.

## Improvements & Bug Fixes
* **Group Access report was optimized**. The report now better handles special groups - Everyone and Everyone except external users - and thus loads the selection step faster.
* **Improved the sensitivity label dropdown** used when creating a provisioning template. In some cases, the dropdown would show the senstivitiy label GUID instead of a friendly name. Instead of the name property, Syskit Point now shows display name. 
* **Fixed an issue** where owners would get an empty screen with infinite loading animation instead of an appropriate message in case they opened a link to workspace they don't have access to. Now, the Access Denied meesage is displayed.
* **Fixed a bug** where changing Audit Log settings and activities to collect was not applied instantly but only after app services restart. 
* **Automated Workflows were renamed to Policies**. You will see the change in multiple screens - settings, governance screens, etc. 
* **Various improvements and minor fixes are available**.
