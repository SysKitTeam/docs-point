## Improvements & Bug Fixes

* **SysKit Point is optimized for faster performance**! Multiple changes were made in the background to make SysKit Point work better than ever:
    * **SQL optimizations** resulting in **improved speed of Teams & Groups overview screen and site details screen**
    * **Audit logs read and write operation optimizations**, resulting in **improved performance of all audit log reports and faster analytics calculations**.
    **Please note!** Due to optimizations, SysKit Point will automatically migrate audit logs to a new CosmosDB storage container outside of working hours. As a result, some audit logs might temporarily be inaccessible in the app until the migration is finished.
    * **Group members sync optimized** only to run when membership changes are detected with the help of delta queries
    * **Analytics tile** visible on the site details screen and the **Automated Workflows screen** in settings were **optimized to load data faster**
* **SysKit Point initialization screen improved**. The screen automatically refreshes once the service apps start, and the sign-in screen shows.
* **Improved messages in Lifecycle management emails and tasks** if owners donâ€™t resolve a task in time.
* **Fixed an issue** where SysKit Point would not correctly detect if access to Microsoft Teams protected API is granted.
* **Fixed an issue** where last the login data was not visible on the SysKit Point Collaborators report in Settings.
* **Fixed a bug** where Global Viewers could not manage their scheduled reports.
* **Fixed an issue** where the Microsoft Teams analytics dashboard would timeout when the date filter is set to Last 30 days. 
* **Various UX/UI improvements and minor fixes** are available. The most noticeable change is the **redesigned SysKit Point sign-in screen**.
