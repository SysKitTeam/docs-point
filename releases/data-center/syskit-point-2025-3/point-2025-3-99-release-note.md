## Improvements & Bug Fixes

* **Changed the default Cosmos backup policy mode from Periodic to Continuous (7 days) for new Enterprise deployments**. \
This brings the following advantages:
  * 7 days of Cosmos backup for free
  * Point in time restore
  * Self-service restore (without the need to contact Microsoft support)
  * **Please note that a one-time charge occurs when restoring the Cosmos DB.**
    * [Find more information about the cost calculation in the following article.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/continuous-backup-restore-introduction#continuous-backup-pricing)
  * **This change doesn't affect existing Enterprise customers**. Still, it is recommended to switch to the continuous backup policy mode due to the advantages listed above.
    * [For more information about the migration from periodic to continuous backup mode, please visit this link.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/migrate-continuous-backup)

  * **Custom SharePoint Agents Invetory report** in added report columns.
  * **SharePoint Agent details screen** in the General Info tile.
  * **Note that syncing the workspace is required to collect the Created By and Modified By data for SharePoint Agents.**

* **Added support for multi-geo environments** when using the **Clean Up File Versions** action for storage.

* **Improved the performance** of the Teams & Groups overview screen when filtering by Sensitivity labels.

* **Fixed an issue** with Private and Shared channels sync caused by changes in channel URLs.
  * Unsuccessful sync caused failure of management actions on Private Channels in some cases.

* **Fixed an issue** where Entra ID roles were not recognized as SharePoint site owners in the Maximum Number of Owners policy details report. 

* **Fixed an issue** where the PowerBI sync would result in the following error: 
```Power BI Sync Error: Batch with Id {BatchId} failed. Microsoft.Data.SqlClient.SqlException: Cannot insert duplicate key row in object 'PowerBIData.Datasources' with unique index 'UX_Datasources_Guid'. The duplicate key value is (<objectID>). The statement has been terminated.```
