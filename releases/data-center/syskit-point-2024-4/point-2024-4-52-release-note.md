## New Features

* **New Copilot Readiness tile available on the Dashboard!**
  * With the help of the Copilot Readiness score, **you can easily detect areas of improvement or potential security concerns as you prepare to integrate Copilot** into your day-to-day business.
  * The Copilot Readiness tile shows all of the **policy vulnerabilities or overshared workspaces** that could pose a security risk. 
  * The following is counted for the Copilot Readiness: 
    * Number of vulnerabilities detected for the Workspaces with Too Many Members, Workspaces with Shadow Users, and Workspaces Shared with Everyone policies.
    * The Group Access and Sharing Links reports
    * The number of company-wide sharing links and links shared with everyone
    * The number of public workspaces

* **Improvements made to Storage Management for SharePoint Online!**
  * **Storage Versioning Limits** are now available in the Syskit Point Settings for Storage Management. 
    * Storage Versioning Limits help you limit the number of file versions kept in SharePoint document libraries.
    * The versioning limit that can be set is either a **Count Limit or Time Limit**. 
    * File versions are deleted after exceeding the number of versions or the time period you set. 
    * The Storage Versioning Limits can be applied automatically or manually. 
    * For more details on versioning limits, [take a look at this article.](../../storage-management/versioning-limits.md)
  * **The Site Storage Metrics report** has three new views available that detect workspaces without activity
    * The new views available are: 
      * Without Activity in the Last 90 Days
      * Without Activity in the Last 180 Days
      * Without Activity in the Last 365 Days 
    * These views show **workspaces that have not had activity registered or have not been modified** in the selected time frame. 

  * **Added the option to hide the Workspace name from the URL link and e-mails when creating Provisioning templates**. 
    * When the option is enabled, the URL and e-mail contain a number identifier (6-10 characters) instead of the workspace name.
    * Hiding the workspace name from the URL or e-mail can be useful when dealing with confidential workspaces where you don't want to disclose any information, even in the URL or e-mail. Additionally, if you think a workspace name will change with time, you can use this option and have a unique URL and e-mail that doesn't have to change with future changes.
    * For more details, [please take a look at this article.](../../governance-and-automation/provisioning/hide-workspace-name.md)

## Improvements & Bug Fixes

* **Sensitivity Label and Retention Label** columns are now available on the Unique Permissions and Sharing Links reports and can be selected from the column chooser.
     * You can easily **find files with specific Sensitivity and Retention labels** with the help of the column filters.

* **Improvements made to storage management actions!**
  * **Fixed an issue** where Storage clean-up actions failed due to workspaces' retention policy. 
    * The action log now notifies you that the clean-up action could not be performed on the workspace due to a hold or retention period assigned to it. 
  * **Fixed a bug** that allowed Global Viewers to perform Storage clean-up actions. 

* **Improvements made to the Lifecycle Management** feature when selecting to keep workspaces.
  * The default period is now set for 90 days when the keep action is selected, and the maximum limit is set to indefinitely.

* **Improvements made to Access Review**.
  * On the Sharing step, the default Sharing view is now set to Show by Users.
  * The Department column is now displayed for users on the Sharing step by default. 

* **Improved the Provisioning process** to be more resilient and better handle errors. This should help avoid provisioning failures when creating new Microsoft Teams.

* **Fixed an issue** that prevented the Private Workspaces Shared with Everyone policy from correctly detecting vulnerabilities.

* **Fixed an issue** where the following error would occur when attempting to complete the Yammer registration setup: 
`{"message":"An error has occurred.","exceptionMessage":"Unexpected character encountered while parsing value: i. Path '', line 0, position 0.","exceptionType":"Newtonsoft.Json.JsonReaderException"}`

* **Fixed a bug** that allowed users to apply previously deleted sensitivity labels.


* **Improvements made to the Private Workspaces Shared with Everyone policy!** 
  * The Private Workspaces Shared with Everyone policy can now be resolved manually or automatically.
    * **Resolve Manually**: The vulnerability is flagged on the Security and Compliance Dashboard, where manual actions can be taken to resolve it. 
    * **Resolve Automatically**: Syskit Point automatically resolves the vulnerability by removing access granted to Everyone, Everyone except external users, and All users groups. 
    * [For more details on the Private Workspaces Shared with Everyone policy, take a look at this article.](../../governance-and-automation/automated-workflows/private-workspaces-shared-with-everyone-admin.md)

  * **Reports now have a new Copilot Readiness tag.**
    * You can now select Copilot Readiness from the filter categories on Reports and the search bar.

    * Use these reports and checks to deal with overshared and inactive content and prepare your environment for Copilot.
  * **The Group Access report** no longer shows deleted workspaces when generated.

* **The Security & Compliance Checks Dashboard** has two new columns added: New (Last 30 Days) and Resolved (Last 30 Days).
  * The **New (Last 30 Days)** column shows the number of new vulnerabilities detected per each policy in the last 30 days.
