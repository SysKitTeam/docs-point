## New Features

* **New policy available**: Inactive Workspaces
  * Inactive Workspaces are workspaces that have been inactive for the time period set by administrators. 
  * This policy helps you clean up inactive workspaces to save storage space and keep your environment running smoothly. 
    * [For more details about the Inactive Workspaces policy, read this article.](../../../governance-and-automation/automated-workflows/inactive-workspaces-admin.md)
  * Once an inactive workspace is detected, it is flagged as a vulnerability and can be found in the Security & Compliance dashboard.
    * [To find out more on how to resolve the detected vulnerability, read the related Security & Compliance report article.](../../../governance-and-automation/security-compliance-checks/inactive-workspaces.md)
  * Administrators can resolve the vulnerability, or workspace owners can resolve the task if task delegation is enabled.
    * [Read this article to learn how collaborators can resolve the Inactive Workspaces task.](../../../point-collaborators/resolve-governance-tasks/inactive-workspaces.md)
  * [The Inactive Workspaces report](../../../reporting/analytics-reports.md#inactive-workspaces-report) has been improved to reflect the new Inactive Workspaces policy. 
  * [For details on what will happen to the Lifecycle Management feature, please read this article.](../../../governance-and-automation/lifecycle-management/deprecating-lifecyle-management.md)


* **New check was added to the Copilot Readiness tile.**
  * A **sensitive files** check has been added to the tile, showing the total number of sensitive content shared **on public Microsoft Teams & Groups**. 
    * This report can be generated by **clicking the number showing the amount of sensitive file(s)** in public Teams & Groups and is located under the tile's Evaluate Public Microsoft Teams & Groups section.
  * [Learn more about the checks available on the tile in the Copilot Readiness article.](../../../microsoft365-inventory/copilot-readiness.md)

* **New Report available!**
  * **The Sensitivity Labels Inventory** report lets you **find workspaces and files** where a specific sensitivity label is applied.
  * For more details, [take a look at the Sensitivity Labels reports article.](../../../reporting/sensitivity-labels.md#sensitivity-labels-inventory-report)
  
* **New Review types available:**
  * **Sensitivity Review**
    * Administrators can now enable workspace owners to review sensitivity labels for their workspaces. This helps ensure that all workspaces and documents are labeled appropriately. 
    * [For more information on the Ask Owners to Manage Sensitivity action, take a look at this article.](../../../governance-and-automation/sensitivity-review/request-sensitivity-review.md)
  * **Privacy Review**
    * Administrators can now enable workspace owners to review the privacy settings for their workspaces. This gives workspace owners the ability to ensure only the necessary people have access and that their workspace has the correct privacy level. 
    * [Take a look at the Ask Owners to Manage Privacy article for more details.](../../../governance-and-automation/privacy-review/request-privacy-review.md)    


## Improvements & Bug Fixes

* **Improvements made to Metadata!**
  * **Improvements made to Completed Metadata Tasks.**
    * **By clicking a workspace** on the completed Metadata Review overview screen, **you are taken to the Review - Summary**.
      * On the Review - Summary screen, you can see the actions taken for this workspace, who the action was performed by and when, and any comments the reviewer left when resolving the task.  
  * **Metadata information and actions** have been added to the general tile on the workspace details screen for Microsoft 365 Teams, Microsoft 355 Groups, and SharePoint Sites. 
    * You can now change metadata, remove metadata, or ask owners to review metadata directly from that workspace's details screen. 

* **When Provisioning a workspace**, the Site Theme is now copied when you select one of the following options: 
  * Copy Team SharePoint Site - **Structure**
  * Copy Team SharePoint Site - **Structure & Content**
  * **Only the Site Theme is copied**, which means the header, navigation, or other aspects of **the site's look are not copied**.

* **New options were added** to the Minimum Number of Owners and Maximum Number of Owners Policies.
  * When selecting the user that gets unresolved tasks reassigned after owners do not resolve the policy vulnerability, you can also add that user as a workspace member.  
  * This helps you ensure resolvers can access the workspace, examine it, and decide how best to resolve the policy vulnerability task.
 
* **E-mails sent to owners/task resolvers** when accepting risk for policy vulnerability tasks, now use a grouped e-mail template. If the action was performed in bulk, resolvers will get one e-mail with multiple workspaces listed.
  * E-mails sent when undoing the accept risk command and those sent when clicking the Send Reminder action on Security & Compliance reports are grouped as well, thus reducing the number of e-mails sent to task resolvers while providing the same essential information.

* **Improved the processing** of e-mails sent from Syskit Point. 
  * E-mails are now sent in batches to better handle underlying job queues.

* **Fixed an issue** when provisioning a new site by using the "Copy from existing site/team" option that caused provisioning to fail in the following situations:
  * When copying content types with fields that do not exist in the destination site. 
  * When copying theme options when certain colors were used.

* **Fixed an issue** where the Shared with Everyone policy violations were triggered for workspaces that are not shared with everyone. 

* **Fixed a bug** that caused the Access Review sharing step view to appear empty. 

* **Fixed a bug** when generating the Permission Matrix report from the Sites Details screen that prevented list items from appearing in the report.

* **Fixed an issue** that caused sensitivity labels not to apply properly when provisioning a workspace.

* **Fixed a bug** that caused a failure to start an Access Review for a team that had Private Channels connected. 

* **Various improvements and minor UX and UI fixes are available**.
