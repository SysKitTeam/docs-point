## Are there any limits in the trial version of the tool?

We believe it is best to see SysKit Point in action using your real data and we want to give you the possibility to set up and try SysKit Point in under 10 minutes.
Therefore, **only for trial purposes**, we have put in place the following limitations:
 * Load is limited to 10 000 000 files, ​

Of course! Our support team is available Monday through Friday from 8AM to 8PM CET, but you can email them 24/7 at support@syskit.com. Also please be sure to check our detailed technical documentation to [help you get started](../get-to-know-syskit-point/point-starter-kit.md).

## Do you offer trial extensions? 

We do not offer trial extensions. We recommend starting a monthly subscription which you can cancel at any time.

## What happens when my trial ends? 

If you haven’t chosen a pricing plan before your free trial ends, then your account will be frozen at the end date of the free trial. You will still be able to select a pricing plan for the next 21 days, after which your data will be destroyed as per the [DPA (Data Processing Addendum)](https://www.syskit.com/data-processing-addendum/).
