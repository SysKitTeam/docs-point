## Why can't I manage a subscription in the Subscriptions Portal?
Currently, **only the user who initially purchased the subscription can manage it**.

Additional users may have access to the Subscriptions portal, but they will not be able to manage the subscription (purchase additional user licenses, for example). When such a user tries to manage the subscription, the Manage Subscription button turns red when clicked.

If you want to change the user responsible for subscription management, please contact your Customer Success Manager or [Syskit support](https://support.syskit.com/hc/en-us).
If you purchased your subscription via a partner network, contact the partner/reseller to update your subscription.
