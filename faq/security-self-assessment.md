# Security Self Assessment Questionnaire

We use the Consensus Assessments Initiative Questionnaire Lite (CAIQ-Lite) from the Cloud Security Alliance as a baseline mechanism to express our security posture in real terms and provide security control transparency.

We've made this publicly available to help customers assess our security posture for their vendor management initiatives. Please [contact us](https://www.syskit.com/company/contact-us) if you have any questions or concerns.



| Category | Control Heading | Original ID | Question | Answer | Comments | 
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Application & Interface Security |  Interface Security    Application Security | AIS-01.2 | Do you use an automated source code analysis tool to detect security defects in code prior to production? | Yes | We run automated tests that are enforced by Azure DevOps. We use two kinds of checks for all code: • Static code analysis (SAST) – for this, we use SonarCloud https://sonarcloud.io/features. It is integrated straight into the DevOps with Pull Request decoration making sure bugs are highly visible and preventing the merge to the main branches. All issues are resolved before the code can reach the main branch, and we currently have no bugs, vulnerabilities or security hotspots inside our main branch. • Software Composition Analysis (SCA) – we regularly scan our code for known vulnerabilities using OWASP Dependency-check. The tool uses the National Vulnerability Database in the background. Our policy is to fix the highest severity (Critical, High) items ASAP and release a new product update. |
|  | Policy Interface | AIS-01.5 |  (SaaS only) Do you review your applications for security vulnerabilities and address any issues prior to deployment to production? | Yes | We perform manual reviews alongside automated testing. All code changes go to pull requests that require two reviews other than the creator to approve. All defects found during testing are prioritized and fixed before going to production. We also subject our platform to third-party penetration testing annually. |
| | Customer Access Requirements | AIS-02.1 | Are all identified security, contractual, and regulatory requirements for customer access contractually addressed and remediated prior to granting customers access to data, assets, and information systems? | Yes | We provide full details of this via our customer agreement, terms of use and privacy policy on our website. |
|  | Data Integrity | AIS-03.1 | Does your data management policies and procedures require audits to verify data input and output integrity routines? | Yes | Data integrity is checked and audited via extensive end-to-end tests, human review, and penetration testing. |
