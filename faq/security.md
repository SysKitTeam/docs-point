## Does Syskit Point perform database backups? Are these backups encrypted? 
Syskit Point uses two types of Azure resources to store data:
* **Azure SQL Database**, and
* **Azure Cosmos DB**

**Azure SQL** provides automated backups which use integrated SQL Transparent Data Encryption. These backups are retained for 7 days. With these backups, Azure SQL Database supports Point in Time Restore, which allows a database to be restored to any point in time, up to the millisecond, within a databaseâ€™s retention period.

**Azure Cosmos DB** is set to Continuous (7-day) backup policy mode. The Continuous backup policy mode enables point-in-time restore and self-service restore (without the need to contact Microsoft support). This configuration is the default option for new Data Center deployments from [July 15, 2025 onwards](../releases/data-center/syskit-point-2025-3/point-2025-3-99-release-note.md#improvements--bug-fixes), and it is offered without any extra cost. Existing customers can change the default backup interval in the Azure Portal.

## How is data at rest encrypted?

Transparent data encryption (TDE) helps protect Azure SQL Database against the threat of malicious offline activity by encrypting data at rest. The algorithm used for encryption is AES-256.

As a PaaS service, Azure Cosmos DB is very easy to use. Because all user data stored in Azure Cosmos DB is encrypted at rest and in transport, you don't have to take any action. Another way to put this is that encryption at rest is "on" by default, and there are no controls to turn it off or on. Azure Cosmos DB uses AES-256 encryption on all regions where the account is running. We provide this feature while we continue to meet our [availability and performance SLAs](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/support/legal/sla/cosmos-db/v1_4/). Data stored in your Azure Cosmos account is automatically and seamlessly encrypted with keys managed by Microsoft (service-managed keys). Optionally, you can choose to add a second layer of encryption with your keys, as described in the [customer-managed keys article](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/how-to-setup-cmk).
  
## How is the integrity of file and message data ensured? How is data in transit secured?

The solution uses TLS 1.2 and HTTPS to secure all messages.

## Can I host Syskit Point in my own Azure subscription?

Yes, Syskit Point can be hosted by yourself in your own Azure subscription. Self-hosting is only available for the Data Center plan and will require additional installation and onboarding fees. Feel free to contact us to get more information about the Data Center plan.


## Do you perform both manual and automated testing as a part of your Quality Assurance process?

Yes, Syskit believes that the quality of the product is extremely important for our customer satisfaction. We have quality assurance processes in place, and both manual and automated testing are included.

## What happens to customer data once that Syskit Point subscription or trial period is over?

In the first phase, we will freeze your data for a period of 21 days, in which period you will still be able to select a pricing plan but won't be able to use any of the reports. After this period of 21 days, your data will be destroyed as per the DPA (Data Processing Agreement). 

## Why do I need to grant Global Admin permissions to Syskit Point?

For the first connection and some bigger upgrades, a global administrator needs to give consent to Syskit Point on your tenant. This consent allows us to crawl your environment and perform management actions from Syskit Point. During that process, the Syskit Point instance is registered in Microsoft Entra ID as an Active Directory Application. For various product functionalities, we use Azure, Microsoft Graph, and SharePoint Online APIs to perform certain actions. For some of these actions and crawls, we need delegated permissions, which is why a global admin must consent on behalf of all users in your tenant.
