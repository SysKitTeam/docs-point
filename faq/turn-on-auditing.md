# Turn On Auditing

For SysKit Point to be able to collect, process, and save audit logs, the auditing has to be enabled in your tenant. If the auditing is not properly configured, the following warning message is displayed in the SysKit Point Configuration Wizard:   
  
`Error starting a subscription. It may take up to 24h after initial audit configuration for this step to work.`

Although the SysKit Point configuration can be finished at this point, audit data cannot be collected.

To turn on auditing, first, open the following URL in your browser of choice: [https://protection.office.com/unifiedauditlog](https://protection.office.com/unifiedauditlog)

The Office 365 Security & Compliance Center will open, showing the Audit log search page. At the top, a yellow warning bar is displayed. On the right side of the warning bar, you can find the **Turn on auditing button** â€“ click it to turn on auditing.

Once the page is refreshed, a different warning message appears telling us the **auditing can take a couple of hours** to be made available.

When the page is refreshed at a later point in time, another warning message is displayed, with more precise information on how long it might take for the audit logs to be visible.
