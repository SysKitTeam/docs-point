# Microsoft Teams Activity Tracking

{% hint style="info" %}
**Microsoft Teams Activity Tracking** is available in the Governance plan and higher tiers. See the [pricing page](https://www.syskit.com/products/point/pricing/) for more details.
{% endhint %}

**Syskit Point** enables you to easily **discover which of your Microsoft Teams are not being actively used**.

Syskit Point uses Microsoft Graph API, which makes it possible for Syskit Point to **detect inactive Microsoft Teams based on the date of the last message.**

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Please note!**\
Syskit Point **does not read or save** the content of messages to detect Microsoft Teams activity. 
{% endhint %}

To learn more about Graph API, read the [following article](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/use-the-api).
