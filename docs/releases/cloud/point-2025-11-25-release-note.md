## Improvements & Bug Fixes 

* **Improvements made to Workspace Review.**
  * A new report view is now available on the Govern > Workspace Review > Overview > View Details screen. 
  * Access the new report view by enabling the Show Reviewers per Workspace toggle icon in the report toolbar for a detailed breakdown of reviewers assigned to each workspace. 
  * The report lists all reviewers for each workspace, including the designated manager and that manager’s email address.

* **Fixed an issue** on the Shared Channel Details screen that caused the wrong Microsoft Team to be opened when drilling down to the teams level. 

* **Fixed an issue** that prevented archiving Sites that contain subsites, with the following unauthorized access error: `An exception occurred while trying to archive [workspace name]. System.UnauthorizedAccessException: Attempted to perform an unauthorized operation.`

* **Added an option** for creating modern SharePoint Sites through **Provisioning templates**.
  * You can now provision a SharePoint Site without creating a Microsoft 365 Group or Team.

* **Fixed an issue** where the site URL was missing from the Orphaned Workspaces report when exported as an XLSX file.
  * The site URL is now included in Excel exports for the report, and the URL column is available in the column chooser. 

* **Various improvements, including UX and UI fixes, are available.**
