# November 2, 2023 - Announcement

Syskit Point is constantly evolving to serve you better, and with this release, we wanted to bring your attention to **2 enhancements that will require your action**. 

 
## When Can You Expect the New Release? 
The new version is planned to be deployed on Thursday, 2nd of November. Depending on your region, you can expect to see the notification in Syskit Point on that day or within the following 24 hours. 

## ACTION NO.1: Reconsent to Grant Permissions 
**We have enhanced the action for adding members to private channels in Microsoft Teams**, making it even more robust. However, to ensure the smooth functioning of this functionality, there are new app permissions that need to be granted. 

**What Do You Need to Do?** 

Upon your first sign-in to the new version of Syskit Point, you will notice a notification at the bottom of the Welcome Home screen stating: "Global Admin Reconsent Needed - Grant permissions to Syskit Point to use the latest feature." 

To ensure that the functionality work seamlessly: 
* Ask your Global Administrator to sign in to Syskit Point. 
* Click on the "Reconsent" option on the displayed notification. 
* Grant permissions in the Microsoft dialog  

[For a detailed step-by-step guide, please refer to our documentation](../../requirements/permission-requirements-change-log.md).  

**What Happens If You Don't Reconsent?**

Without the required permissions, the efficiency and accuracy of this functionality can be affected, so we highly recommend taking the necessary action to avoid any disruptions. This is purely to ensure that you get the most out of Syskit Point. 

## ACTION NO.2: Upgrade the Syskit Point Teams App   

**We have improved the Syskit Point Teams App to ensure compatibility with the New Microsoft Teams**. We highly advise upgrading the Syskit Point Teams App to eliminate any potential compatibility issues once you decide to migrate to the New Microsoft Teams. 

**What Do You Need to Do?** 

To avoid potential issues in the New Microsoft Teams, please follow these steps after the upgrade is rolled out: 

* Navigate to Settings > Governance > Provisioning. 
* Click the "Update Microsoft Teams App" button. 

[For more information, please refer to our documentation](../../governance-and-automation/syskit-point-teams-app.md#upgrade-syskit-point-teams-app). 

**What Happens If You Don't Upgrade?**

Not upgrading may result in compatibility issues with the New Microsoft Teams, affecting the functionality of the Syskit Point Teams App.
