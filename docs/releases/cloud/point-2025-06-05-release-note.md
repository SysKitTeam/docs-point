  * **The maximum allowed length** for group or team emails has been restricted to avoid provisioning failure.

* **Added a warning** when a Microsoft 365 Group associated with a SharePoint Site has been permanently deleted or vice versa. Â 
  * The following warning will appear on the Group or Site details screen: `The connected group/site has been deleted. As a result, you cannot perform any actions.`
