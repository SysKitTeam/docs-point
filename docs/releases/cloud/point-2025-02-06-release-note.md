## Improvements & Bug Fixes

* **Improvements made to Security and Compliance Checks**: Inactive Workspaces.
  * **Clicking the ellipsis (three dots)** next to the *Send Reminder* button opens a dropdown menu with the following actions: **Change Admins, Keep, Delete, Archive**. 
  * Hovering over the ellipsis now displays a *More Actions* tooltip. 

* **Fixed an issue** where users falsely appeared as shadow users on the security & compliance report, although they are members of the workspace's unified group. This happened if the same members also had access given via a sharing link.

* **Various improvements, including UX and UI fixes, are available**.
