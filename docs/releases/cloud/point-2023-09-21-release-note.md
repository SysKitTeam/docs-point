## Bug Fixes

* **Fixed a bug** where the Copy User Permissions action would erroneously copy permission of the source user to all existing team members on private channels where the source user had permissions. The issue manifested if:
  * **Copy memberships in Microsoft Teams private channels option was enabled** when performing the action. 
  * **The selected destination user was recently added to the tenant and not synced in Syskit Point**.
SharePoint sites and Team memberships were not affected by this issue.
* **Fixed an issue** where the Delete action was not visible on the Inactive Guest User screen when drilled from the Security & compliance dashboard.
* **Fixed a bug** where the Automated column showed incorrect values for some policies on the Policies settings screen.
* **Various improvements and minor fixes are available**.
