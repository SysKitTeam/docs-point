## Improvements & Bug Fixes 

* **Fixed an issue** where e-mails were deleted before being sent.
  * If the option to save sent e-mails to Exchange was disabled, e-mails would remain in Drafts without being sent.
  * The e-mails would then be considered sent by Syskit Point, which consequently deleted them, resulting in most e-mails never being delivered. 

* **Fixed a bug** that caused Sites deleted by the configured retention policy to erroneously duplicate with a different state and show up in the Deleted Sites view. 

* **Fixed a bug** that caused the User Sync status to display an incorrect last successful sync time. 

* **Fixed an issue** where Everyone sharing alerts were not triggered successfully.
  * When files or folders were shared with an Everyone group, alerts were not triggered as expected. 

* **Various improvements, including UX and UI fixes, are available.**
