## Improvements & Bug Fixes

* **Fixed an issue** that caused a timeout when clicking the View All Actions button and loading the Actions Report.
  * New views were added to the report with the default time set as 7 days. Â 

* **Fixed issues with Provisioning.**
  * When provisioning a new site by using the "Copy from existing site" option, provisioning would fail when copying content types with fields that do not exist in the destination site. 
  * Provisioning would fail when copying theme options if certain colors were used.
  * Provisioning did not apply metadata correctly; instead, it showed the following error: `SysKit.Point.SPO.Graph.Exceptions.MicrosoftGraphClientException: Error happened while resolving teamAsyncOperation at SysKit.Point.SPO.Graph.GraphGroupManager.innerResolveAsyncTeamOperation(Guid teamId, Guid operationId, Int32 resolveRetryCount, Int32 retryCount, Int32 timeoutInSeconds, Nullable'1 remainingRetryCount)`

* **Fixed a bug** that caused the Site Details screen to crash for those without the Governance License for their Syskit Point.

* **Various improvements and minor UX and UI fixes are available**.
