## Improvements & Bug Fixes 

* **The following improvements** to provisioning have been made:
  * **Users are now prevented** from adding guest users as group or team owners when provisioning a workspace. 
  * **The maximum allowed length** for group or team e-mails has been restricted to avoid provisioning failure.
  * **Fixed the missing error message** when provisioning fails, so it no longer shows as `null`.
  * **Fixed the issue** that caused provisioning to fail when the same user is assigned as both the primary and secondary contact.

* **Added a warning** when a Microsoft 365 Group associated with a SharePoint Site has been permanently deleted or vice versa. Â 
  * The following warning will appear on the Group or Site details screen: `The connected group/site has been deleted. As a result, you cannot perform any actions.`

* **Fixed layout issues** when displaying long workspace names in the Point Teams App and e-mails related to provisioning requests. 

* **Various improvements and minor UX and UI fixes are available**.
