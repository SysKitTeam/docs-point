# My Tasks

The **Tasks** tile is located on the left side of Syskit Point, and a notification bubble displays the number of tasks that need to be reviewed.

To view tasks assigned to you, click the **Tasks button (1)** in your Syskit Point.

Click **Review** to continue. The **Access Review Task** screen opens - the same screen that can be accessed from email, as explained in the previous section.

The same can be done for any type of task assigned to you, for example, [lifecycle management](../resolve-governance-tasks/lifecycle-management.md), or others.  

On the screen that opens, click the **link in the Task column** to continue and review a site.
