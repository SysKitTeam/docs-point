* **Select the Power Platform category in the filter** in the upper left corner.
* **Click the Power Platform Connections report tile** to be redirected to the Selection screen.

When generating the Power Platform Connections report, the first step is the **selection screen** which opens as a list of available [Power Platform Environments](power-platform-environments-reports.md). This step allows you to **select which environments you want included** in the report.
