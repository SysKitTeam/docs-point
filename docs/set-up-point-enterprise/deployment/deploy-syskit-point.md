## Azure Resources Deployment

Before deploying Azure resources needed to run Syskit Point, you will be prompted to configure several options grouped into four tabs:
* **Basics**
* **Web application settings**
* **Storage settings**
* **Network configuration**

The last available tab - **Review + create** - shows an overview of all configured options to check before the deployment is started.

The **Basics** tab enables you to:
* **Select the Azure subscription (1)**
* **Select an existing** or **create a new resource group (2)** within which the Syskit Point resources will be created
* **Choose the Azure region (3)** where Syskit Point resources will be created
* **Click Next (4)** to proceed to the **Web application settings** tab

![Basics Tab](../../../static/img/deploy-syskit-point-basics.png)


On the **Web application settings** tab, you will need to define the following:
* **Website Name (1)**; must be a unique name to create FQDN; the resulting Point web app URL will be: `{websiteName}.azurewebsites.net`
* **Web Application Time Zone (2)**
* **Web Service Tier (3)**
* **Click Next (4)** to continue with the **Storage settings** configuration

![Web Application Settings Tab](../../../static/img/deploy-syskit-point-web-app-settings.png)

Define the following on the **Storage settings** tab:
* **Azure SQL Tier (1)**
* **SQL Account (2)**
* **SQL Password (3)**; enter the same password in the **Confirm SQL Password (4)** field
* **Cosmos Tier (5)**
* **Click Next (6)** to move to the **Network configuration** tab

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Please note!** This is mandatory to **provision a new SQL server** as this is a Microsoft requirement. Without the SQL credentials, it would not be possible to create the SQL server; however, after the initial deployment, the credentials will not be used again. The SQL authentication is disabled, and Managed Identity authentication will be used in the future. 
{% endhint %}

![Azure SQL Settings Tab](../../../static/img/deploy-syskit-point-azure-sql-settings.png)

The **Network configuration** tab enables you to **configure virtual network** used by Syskit Point resources.
Depending on your use case, you have **two options available**:
* **Use the predefined virtual network configuration** - a new virtual network is created when deploying Syskit Point; no additional configuration is needed, and you can **proceed to the next step by clicking the Next button (1)**, or
* **Customize the virtual network settings by clicking the Edit virtual network (2) option**

![Network Configuration Tab](../../../static/img/deploy-syskit-point-network-configuration.png)

If you click the Edit virtual option, a new screen appears where you can change the predefined settings:
* **Name (1)** of the virtual network
* **Address range (2)**
* **Names and address ranges (3)** for **Default**, **FE app service**, and **BE app service subnets**


{% hint style="warning" %}
**Please note!**  
Predefined ranges comply with the minimum requirements for Syskit Point resources to work properly.
If you decide to change the predefined values, **ensure that all subnets have 255 IP addresses reserved**.
{% endhint %}

**Click OK** when you finish the virtual network setup. 

![Create Virtual Network Screen](../../../static/img/deploy-syskit-point-create-virtual-network.png)

The **Review + create** tab shows the following information:
* **Configuration summary (1)** showing all options selected in previous steps
* **Create button (2)**; once clicked, the deployment of Azure resources starts

![Review + create Tab](../../../static/img/deploy-syskit-point-review.png)

At the start of the deployment, you will be redirected to a page showing the deployment progress. After 5-10 minutes, the deployment is complete, and the **Go to resource group (1)** button appears, as shown in the image below. Click the button to open the **Resource group's Overview page**, showing all created Azure resources.

{% hint style="success" %}
With the described deployment, **all Azure resources needed to run Syskit Point are created**, and no additional installation is needed.
You can now **access Syskit Point by opening the Syskit Point web app URL in a browser**.
{% endhint %}

## Syskit Point Web App URL

To view the Syskit Point web app URL, do the following:
* **Navigate to the Overview screen** of the created resource group
* **Find and click the app service resource (1)**
* **Click the URL link (2)** available in the Essentials section on the app service's Overview screen

The Syskit Point web page opens.
First, you will be prompted to [activate Syskit Point](../activation/activate-syskit-point.md)
Once activated, Syskit Point will guide you through the process of [connecting to a tenant for the first time](connect-to-tenant.md).
