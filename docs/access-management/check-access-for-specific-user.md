# Check Access for Specific Microsoft 365 User

## User Access in Microsoft 365 Environment

When using **Microsoft 365** for your daily **collaboration**, there are numerous occasions where you will **grant** or **remove access** to specific items in your environment. **Microsoft 365** gives multiple ways of doing that, be it via **direct access** to the file or maybe through **security groups**, **SharePoint groups**, and **sharing links**, among others. After a while, you may lose traction of which user has access to a specific item and how you gave the access. This is where the **Syskit Point User Access report** comes in to save the day.

## Syskit Point User Access Report

### Capabilities

**Syskit Point User Access report** is a powerful tool that allows you to **check** all **access** for **every specific user** in your **Microsoft 365 environment**. It enables you to:

* See what type of **access** does a user have \(**Full Control**, **Edit**, **Contribute**, or **any other level of access** you may have **granted** in your **environment**\).
* Understand **through which channel** is the **access given** to the user \(**Being a member in a SharePoint group**, **Group owner**, **Administrator**, through a **security group** or **directly** to said **user**\).
* Show the **details** from which exact **source** were those rights given to it.
* **Perform** multiple **actions directly** on the report \(**Remove Access**, **Change Owners**, **Change to Member**, **Edit Permissions**, **Remove from Group**, **Remove Sharing Link**\).

### Use Cases

There are multiple occasions where using the **User Access report** will help you successfully manage your **Microsoft 365 environment**.

Some of them are:

* When a **new user** in your **Microsoft 365 environment** is being **onboarded**, quickly check if they have all the correct permissions to succeed in their work.
* When a **user** is being **offboarded** to double-check if they still have access to some information they shouldn't have \(via **Anonymous sharing links**\).
* To check if some external collaborators have access to something they shouldnâ€™t have.
* When reorganizing your environment \(**removing users** from certain **security groups** or **changing permissions** for specific users in your environment\).

After completing the action, you will receive a **notification** containing the **see the result** link, which reloads the report data when clicked. Once the action is completed, the user will no longer have access to any workspace.

Any user that had their access removed will successfully be removed from any private channels they had access to; however, at this time, it is **not possible to remove access from shared channels and Power BI workspaces**.

You can also remove access for a specific user by clicking the user's name from the report. This will redirect you to the **user details screen**.
  * Scroll down to the **Access tile (1)**, and you'll have the option to either **select all workspaces (2)** or select them individually to perform the **Remove Access (3)** action.
