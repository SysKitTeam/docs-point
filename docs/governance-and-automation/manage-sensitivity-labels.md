# Manage Sensitivity Labels

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Please note!**  
To use sensitivity labels, a service account needs to be connected to Syskit Point. For details on how to set up sensitivity labels, take a look at the [Enable Sensitivity Labels article](provisioning/enable-sensitivity-labels.md).

Once set up, **Syskit Point admins and workspace owners can apply or remove the sensitivity labels from workspaces**. 

These changes can be done on the **Sites Overview** and the **Microsoft Teams & Groups Overview** screens.

Complete the following steps to manage your sensitivity labels:
 
* **Click the Sites button (1)** located on the left side of the Syskit Point screen.
   * This can also be done by clicking the Teams & Groups button, but in this example, we will be using Sites.

* **Click the arrow next to the Manage Sensitivity button (3)** to see your options; located on the right side of the screen.
  * **The Apply Sensitivity Label** and **Remove Sensitivity Label** actions show up.
