# Workspace Review Governance: Overview

Once you've accessed the Overview screen by clicking Govern > Workspace Review > Overview, you'll find a quick look at the state of your Workspace Review.

  * **All Reviews** - shows all Workspace Review policies 
  * **In Progress** - shows reviews that are currently in progress 
  * **Future** - shows scheduled reviews that will start sometime in the future
  * **Not Applied** - shows policies that are configured, but are not applied to any workspace
  * **Policy Disabled** - shows Workspace Review policies that are disabled, which means tasks and emails wonâ€™t be sent

Each workspace review contains the following:

* **Time left (4)** to complete the review

* **Percentage of tasks (6)** complete and number of workspaces where the review was completed out of the number of workspaces where it was requested
* **Cancel Review button (7)** - clicking this opens the confirmation dialog, where you need to confirm the cancellation
  * If you cancel a Workspace Review, the following happens:
    * All workspace review tasks are automatically closed with the status 'Canceled'
    * No emails are sent to workspace owners 
    * The canceled review is visible under Govern > Insights > Show by Review
