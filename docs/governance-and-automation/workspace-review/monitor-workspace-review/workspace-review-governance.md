# Monitor Workspace Review

:::warning
**Please note!**\
To monitor workspace reviews, please make sure you have [enabled and configured at least one Workspace Review policy](../setup-workspace-review.md).
:::

The **Workspace Review policy** helps organizations **maintain and secure their Microsoft 365 environment by enabling regular, structured, and recommendation-driven review of the most essential workspace settings**. It provides automated tasks for workspace owners to review and resolve policy violations related to **access, privacy, and sensitivity**. 

Unlike Access Review, which focuses on reviewing users' access, the Workspace Review includes additional governance checks, such as: 

* **Inactive Workspaces** - reviewers can archive or delete workspaces that are no longer in use
* **Minimum Number of Owners** - reviewers can ensure that each workspace has enough active owners
* **Maximum Number of Owners** - reviewers can ensure that workspaces do not have too many owners
* **Privacy and Sensitivity Reviews** - reviewers can ensure that workspaces comply with organizational policies and are correctly labeled

Once you've [created your Workspace Review policies](../setup-workspace-review.md), based on your selected settings, reviewers receive tasks to review and ensure the safety of their workspace regularly. Â 

The Workspace Review in Syskit Point can be viewed from two different roles:

* **Syskit Point Admin user**, as described in this article
* [Syskit Point Collaborator user](../../../point-collaborators/workspace-review/workspace-review-overview.md)

When working with Workspace Review, Syskit Point Admin users can:

* **Define Workspace Review settings**
* **Decide which workspaces the policy applies to**
* **Monitor Workspace Review progress**

While Syskit Point Collaborators can **perform the Workspace Review on workspaces where they are the owner or admin**.

These two roles have **different reports and actions available** before and during the Workspace Review and receive different emails.

In this article, you can find out how **Syskit Point Admins** can monitor the progress of an active Access Review.

## Workspace Review - Governance

On the start date of the automated Workspace Review, **Workspace Review tasks are created in Syskit Point**, and **email requests are sent to reviewers**.

**Each reviewer gets one Workspace Review task**, and that task includes **all workspaces where the said user is an owner or admin**, based on the [how reviewers were defined for that Workspace Review policy](../../../governance-and-automation/workspace-review/setup-workspace-review.md).

To **track the progress** of currently active Workspace Reviews, **request a Workspace Review** for workspaces **manually**, or **cancel an existing review**, Syskit Point Admins can **use the Governance screen**. 

To access the Governance screen, **click the Govern button (1)** on the left side of the screen.

On the Governance screen, the **Workspace Review** is divided into two sections:
* [Overview](workspace-review-overview.md) (2)
* [Insights](workspace-review-insights.md) (3)
