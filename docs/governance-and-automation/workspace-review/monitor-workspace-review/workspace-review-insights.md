# Workspace Review Governace: Insights

Once you've accessed the Overview screen by clicking Govern > Workspace Review > Insights, you'll find more details on the state of your Workspace Review across a period of time.

* The **filter (1)** in the top left corner lets you **choose the time frame you want to generate the information for**, with the following options available:
  * **Last 3 Months**
  * **Last 6 Months**
  * **Last 12 Months**
  * **This Year**
  * **Custom**

* **The Most Used Actions (2)** shows the list of the most used actions for the workspace review, as well as graphs that indicate the number of times an action was performed 

* **Completion Rate (3)**, which shows the percentage of review completion as well as the number of workspaces the review was completed on out of the number of workspaces the review was requested on, for the duration you selected in the top filter

* **Review Activity (4)**, which shows the number of actions taken for the workspace review for the duration you selected in the top filter

  * **In Progress** - whether a workspace review is currently active for the workspace
  * **Review Now action** - lets you complete the review on that workspace by yourself 
  * **Request Review action** - lets you immediately request a Workspace Review for that workspace
