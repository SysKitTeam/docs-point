# Edit Restrictions

**Managing access and visibility of SharePoint sites is a vital part of governance**, helping keep sites secure and prevent oversharing. 

With **the new Restrictions column on the Site Overview screen**, you can now easily view whether a site has: 

* **Restricted Access**, if access to the site is restricted to members of whitelisted groups 
* **Restricted Content Discoverability**, if site content is exempt from Microsoft 365 Copilot
* **Restricted Access and Restricted Content Discoverability**, in case both restrictions are applied the site
* **No Restrictions**, if no access restrictions are applied to the site.

By using **the Edit Restrictions action**, located on the right side of **the Site Overview screen**, you can update these settings for selected sites and choose wheher to restrict access to content, restrict content discoverability, both, or leave a workspace without restrictions. 

**Clicking the Edit Restrictions action (1)** opens the Edit Restrictions dialog where you can make your selection.
