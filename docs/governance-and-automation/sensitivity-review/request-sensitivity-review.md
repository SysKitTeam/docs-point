# Sensitivity Review

Sensitivity labels, designed to classify and protect your data, should be kept up-to-date to reflect any changes to your business needs, handling practices, or compliance requirements. For example, if a certain workspace starts dealing with sensitive matters, the sensitivity level of that workspace might need to be updated. 

Regularly reviewing sensitivity labels helps prevent unauthorized access, ensures data is correctly classified, and avoids any potential security risks. 

The best way to ensure all workspaces are properly classified is to involve workspace owners in this process. Owners have firsthand knowledge of the data within their environments and can ensure the labels applied align with both your company policies and the specific needs of their teams.

With the new Ask Owners to Review Sensitivity action, you can now select workspaces that you want owners to review the sensitivity level for.
