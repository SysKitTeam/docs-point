# Licenses Add-On Overview

Managing your Microsoft 365 licenses helps you ensure no active licenses are unassigned or assigned to inactive users. Syskit Point offers a [Licensing Add-on](https://www.syskit.com/products/point/pricing/) as an add-on to your Point subscription, providing four licensing reports and a tile for the Dashboard that shows an overview of your pricing, making it easier and more effective to track licensing costs. 

The License add-on includes **four enhanced Licenses reports, two new License reports, an updated License Optimization Dashboard tile, and more detailed Settings for the Licenses reports**.

Here, you can find the list of relevant license articles:
