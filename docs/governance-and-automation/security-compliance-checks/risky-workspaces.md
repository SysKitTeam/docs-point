# Risky Workspaces

Syskit Point detects workspaces that were determined to be risky, based on various health factors of the workspace.

Some information about how risk is determined? Or what is expected from peoploe when they see a workspace on this list


You can locate the Risky Workspaces view for Security and Compliance checks by:

* Clicking the number of Risky Workspaces on the Security & Compliance Dashboard tile

Here, you can find the following information:

* **Risk Severity** - shows the level of severity for the risky workspace 
* **Risk Factors** - shows all of the potential vulnerabilities that were detected on the risky workspace
* **Clicking the ellipsis** (three dots) in the right corner of each workspace provides options for reports that can highlight the vulnerabilities for that workspace
