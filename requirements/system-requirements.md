# System Requirements

Before deploying SysKit Point, you will need to ensure all requirements are met. To make the process easier, all information is divided into several articles.

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Please note!**  
**Requirements highly depend on the Microsoft 365 activity, the number of users, and the amount of data in your environment**. The larger the environment, the more resources will be required to run SysKit Point smoothly.
{% endhint %}

When deploying SysKit Point to Cloud you will be dealing with Azure resources instead of physical machines. Two types of Azure resources are required to successfully install and configure SysKit Point:

* [**Azure Virtual Machine**](../installation/deploy-syskit-point-to-cloud/hardware-software-requirements.md#azure-virtual-machine-requirements) where SysKit Point will be installed
* [**Azure SQL database**](../installation/deploy-syskit-point-to-cloud/hardware-software-requirements.md#azure-sql-database-requirements) where SysKit Point will store its data 

Click the appropriate link to learn more about the requirements for each of the mentioned resources.
