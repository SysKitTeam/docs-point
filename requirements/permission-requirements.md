# Permission Requirements

## Installation

To install SysKit Point, you need to have **Local Administrator** privileges on the target installation computer. Once installed, SysKit Point can be used with a non-privileged user account.

## SQL Database

### Creating a new database

To be able to create a new SysKit Point dedicated database, the **user account running the installation and configuration wizard should have the following rights** on the preferred SQL server:

* **dbcreator** 
* **securityadmin**

This allows the account to create a new database and to assign proper privileges after database creation. The install account will be automatically given **db\_owner** privileges on the newly created database, if possible. Otherwise, it is advised that the account is given that privilege manually, as it is needed for upgrading the database.

### Using the existing database

User running SysKit Security Manager will need to be granted the **db\_datareader** rights on the existing Syskit Security Manager database.

## Service Account

**Service Settings** page in Configuration Wizard requires appropriate [service account](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/identity-protection/access-control/service-accounts) details.

A service account is a user account that is created explicitly to provide a security context for services running on Windows Server operating systems. The security context determined the serviceâ€™s ability to access local and network resources. The Windows operating systems rely on services to run various features. These services can be configured through the applications, the Services snap-in, or Task Manager, or by using Windows PowerShell.

**The service account needs to have the following privileges** to be able to run the service, collect Office 365 data and run other associated jobs:

* **local administrator** privileges on the installation computer with UAC control disabled so we can verify your credentials
* **db\_owner** privileges on the created SysKit Point dedicated database
* **log on as Service** rights configured

{% hint style="info" %}
If the service account is outside your domain the account name must be typed in the down-level logon name format: **domain\accountname**
{% endhint %}
