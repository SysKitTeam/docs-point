  successfully install and use SysKit Point.

# Permission Requirements

## Installation

To install SysKit Point, you need to have **Local Administrator** privileges on the target installation computer. Once installed, SysKit Point can be used with a non-privileged user account.

## SQL Database

### Creating a new database

To be able to create a new SysKit Point dedicated database, the **user account running the installation and configuration wizard should have the following rights** on the preferred SQL server:

* **dbcreator** 
* **securityadmin**

This allows the account to create a new database and to assign proper privileges after database creation. The install account will be automatically given **db\_owner** privileges on the newly created database, if possible. Otherwise, it is advised that the account is given that privilege manually, as it is needed for upgrading the database.

### Using the existing database

User running SysKit Point installation will need to be granted the **db\_owner** rights on the existing Syskit Point database.

## Service Account

**Service Settings** page in Configuration Wizard requires appropriate [service account](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/identity-protection/access-control/service-accounts) details.

A service account is a user account that is created explicitly to provide a security context for services running on Windows Server operating systems. The security context determined the serviceâ€™s ability to access local and network resources. The Windows operating systems rely on services to run various features. These services can be configured through the applications, the Services snap-in, or Task Manager, or by using Windows PowerShell.

**The service account needs to have the following privileges** to be able to run the service, [collect Office 365 data](../how-to/collect-office-365-data.md) and run other associated jobs:

* **local administrator** privileges on the installation computer with UAC control disabled so we can verify your credentials
* **db\_owner** privileges on the created SysKit Point dedicated database
* **log on as Service** rights configured

{% hint style="info" %}
If the service account is outside your domain the account name must be typed in the down-level logon name format: **domain\accountname**
{% endhint %}

## Office 365

### Global Administrator

**When connecting to an Office 365 tenant** during the [configuration](https://github.com/SysKitTeam/docs-point/tree/6f0316e1f15f779c3c2e530ae1384197b23c8607/installation-and-configuration/configure-syskit-point.md#connect-to-office-365) process, **you need to connect with a Global Administrator account.**

**The first time you connect to your Office 365 tenant, you will be prompted to give consent** to a set of permissions that SysKit Point requires to function correctly. Additional prompts may show up in the future when installing a newer version of SysKit Point because of new functionality, and in consequence, potentially new required permissions.

### SysKit Point App Permissions

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Please note!**  
Permissions described bellow are automatically granted to SysKit Point by giving consent during the configuration process.
{% endhint %}

To achieve its functionality, SysKit Point is registered as an **Enterprise Application in Azure Active Directory.** The permissions model is based on OAuth and OpenID Connect flows. This enables us to consume all of the APIs provided by Microsoft in a standard and well defined way. It also enables us to use modern authentication including Multi-Factor Authentication.  
SysKit Point requires permissions to access several Microsoft APIs. There are two types of required permissions:

* **Application permissions** - define what SysKit Point can do without a signed in user.
* **Delegated permissions** - define what SysKit Point can do in the name of the signed in user.

The following permissions are required for SysKit Point Enterprise Application:

**Microsoft Graph**

To allow safer access to your Office 365 tenant data and to use Microsoft Authentication for signing in your users to SysKit Point, two additional app registrations are created:

* **SysKit Point Service**
* **SysKit Point Client**

#### SysKit Point Service

**SysKit Point Service** app registration is used for [data Sync](../how-to/collect-office-365-data.md) and [audit log collection](../installation-and-configuration/customize-audit-logs-collection.md). The following permissions enable SysKit Point to perform these actions:

#### Microsoft Graph

#### SysKit Point Client

The second app registration, **SysKit Point Client**, enables users to securely log in to SysKit Point and perform actions they are entitled to do, based on their permissions in Office 365 environment. The following permissions are used:
