# Dashboard Overview

To get a whole picture of your **Office 365 environment**, you must keep an eye on all happening changes.  

The Dashboard screen provides you precisely that! 

You can access the **Dashboard** screen from the **Welcome Home** screen or the **Home dropdown menu** on any other screen within the application.

Here is an example of how it looks.

This summary screen consists of six tiles - Inventory, Users, External Collaboration, Storage, Permissions Review, and Lifecycle Management.

**Please note!** Only **SysKit Point Admin** role can see the Dashboard.
{% endhint %}

### Inventory tile

In Inventory, you can find the information about the **total number of Microsoft teams, Office 365 groups, sites, and OneDrive**. Each of these numbers is drillable, and it will open the Sites Overview screen, that is filtered with the selected resource.

For the **period of the last 30 days**, you can see for each resource the number of new items, if any. 

If you **hover over a bar** which represents a newly added resource, a **tooltip will appear** with the exact date.

To see all resources more detailed, click on **View All** link, and the **Sites Overview** screen will open. 

In the bottom part of the Inventory tile, colored in red, you will find inactive and orphaned resources number if they are present in your environment. 

By clicking on the number of the inactive resource, it will open the **Inactive Content** report. For more information, click [**here**](../common-tasks/inactive-content.md#inactive-content-report). 

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Please note!** The number of inactive resources **will be visible 10 days after the first installation of SysKit Point.** 
{% endhint %}

Similarly, clicking on the number of orphaned resources will open the **Orphaned Resources** report in the **Report Center**.
