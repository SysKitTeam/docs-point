# Dashboard Overview

To get a whole picture of your Office 365 environment, you must keep an eye on all happening changes.  

The Dashboard screen provides you precisely that! 

You can access the **Dashboard** screen from the **Welcome Home** screen or the **Home dropdown menu** on any other screen within the application.

Here is an example of how it looks.

This summary screen consists of six tiles - Inventory, Users, External Collaboration, Storage, Permissions Review, and Lifecycle Management.

**Please note!** Only **SysKit Point Admin** role can see the Dashboard.

### Inventory tile

In Inventory, you can find the information about the **total number of Microsoft teams, Office 365 groups, sites, and OneDrive**. Each of these numbers is drillable, and it will open the Sites Overview screen, that is filtered with the selected resource.

For the **period of the last 30 days**, you can see for each resource the number of new items, if any. 

If you **hover over a bar** which represents a newly added resource, a **tooltip will appear** with the exact date.
