# Upgrade SysKit Point to a new version

Here at **SysKit**, we are regularly improving our applications with useful new features.                                                                                                         

We highly recommend having the latest version available installed to use its maximum potential. 

## Checking for version updates

Every user that holds **SysKit Point Admins role** and opens the application will **receive a popup message** at the bottom of the screen that a **new update is available**.

Link **Read What's New** will open a new tab in your browser at the [**Product Updates**](../product-updates/) ****section in SysKit Point documentation.

Clicking on **Download Latest Version** link will redirect you to [**my.syskit.com**](https://my.syskit.com) page if you have a valid license. From here, you can download the latest version available.

In case you are using a **trial version** of the application, a link **will redirect you** to the **SysKit Point web download page**.

If you **don't want to see** a popup **message** about the **new updates** anymore, close the message.

**Hint!                                                                                                                                                         About** section in the **Settings** screen contains **Check for updates** link inside Point version tile. When you click on it, it will show you if there are new versions available to download. **If you possess the latest version**, it will write an **Already up to date** message.
{% endhint %}
