# Upgrade SysKit Point to a new version

Here at **SysKit**, we are regularly improving our applications with useful new features. We highly recommend having the latest version available installed to use its maximum potential. 

## Checking for version updates

Every user that holds **SysKit Point Admins role** and opens the application will **receive a popup message** at the bottom of the screen that a **new update is available**.

Link **Read What's New** will open a new tab in your browser at the [Product Updates](../product-updates/) section in SysKit Point documentation where you can find out about new features, improvements, and bug fixes by each product version.

Clicking on **Download Latest Version** link will redirect you to our [Customers Portal](https://my.syskit.com/) page if you have a valid license. From here, you can download the latest version available.

In case you are using a **trial version** of the application, a link **will redirect you** to the **SysKit Point web download page**.

If you **don't want to see** a popup **message** about the **new updates** anymore, close the message. Until you log out from the application or close the browser popup won't be shown again.

About** section in the **Settings** screen contains **Check for updates** link inside Point version tile. When you click on it, it will show you if there are new versions available to download. **If you possess the latest version**, it will write an **Already up to date** message.
