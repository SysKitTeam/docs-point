# Upgrade SysKit Point to a new version

Here at **SysKit**, we are regularly improving our applications with useful new features.                                                                                                         

If you are using **SysKit Point**, you want to have the latest version available installed to use its maximum potential. 

## Checking for version updates

Luckily, as soon as the newest version is available to the market, we will notify you through the application, among other marketing activities.

You can always Visit [**What's New**](https://www.syskit.com/products/point/whats-new/) page at our official site to get more in-depth information about how we improved the application.

Every user that holds **SysKit Point Admins role** and opens the application will **receive a popup message** at the bottom of the screen that a **new update is available**.

Link **Read What's New** will open a new tab in your browser at the [**Product Updates**](../product-updates/) ****section in SysKit Point documentation.

Clicking on **Download Latest Version** link will redirect you to **my.syskit.com** page if you have a valid license. From here, you can download the latest version available.

In case you are using a **trial version** of the application, a link **will redirect you** to the **SysKit Point web download page**.

If you **don't want to see** a popup **message** about the **new updates** anymore, close the message.

**Hint** **About** section in the **Settings** screen contains **Check for updates** link inside Point version tile. When you click on it, it will show you if there are new versions available to download. **If you possess the latest version**, it will write an **Already up to date** message.
