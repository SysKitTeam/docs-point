# Supervise Microsoft Teams Private channels

## What are Microsoft Teams Private channels

Microsoft Teams Private channels are focused spaces for collaboration within your Teams so that only users on the team who are owners or members of the private channel can access it. 

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Please note!** Anyone, including guest users can be a member of Private channel as long as they are already a member of the Team within which the Private channel was created.
{% endhint %}

You might want to use a Private channel in situation where you have a group of people who need a focused space to collaborate without having to create a separate team, or they need to discuss sensitive information, such as budgets, resourcing, strateging positioning and so on.

### Who can create a Private channel

By default options in your Microsoft Teams, any Team Owner or Team Member can create a Private channel. Only Guest users aren't allowed to create them in any condition. 

It is possible though to limit the creation of Private channels, on the Settings tab for a team, Team Owners can turn off the ability for team members to create Private channels.

### What can Team Owners and Members see in a Private channel

Team Owners can see the names of all Private channels in their team and they can also delete any of them. They however cannot see any conversations, files shared or a member list of a Private channel if they themselves are not a member of said Private channel.

Team Members can only see the Private channels they are members of. Unless they're added to them they are unable to see that said channels even exists.

### Background of Microsoft Teams Private channels

When you create a Microsoft Teams Private channel, you are actually creating that channel's SharePoint Site collection optimized for file sharing and fast provisioning. The separate site collection is to ensure that the access to private channel files is restricted to only members of the private channel compared to the team site where team owners have access to all the assets within the site collection.

**Please note!** By Microsofts design, Sharepoint Sites of Microsoft Teams Private channels are not visible in the SharePoint Admin Center
