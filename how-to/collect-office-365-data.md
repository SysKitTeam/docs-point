# Collect Office 365 Data

## First Run

After you install and configure SysKit Point, all data for SharePoint Online Sites, Microsoft Teams, Office 365 Groups and Office 365 tenant users automatically begins to load. We will call this process **Sync** since the we sync Office 365 tenant data and data in the SysKit Point database.

When you log in to SysKit Point, you will get an appropriate notification telling you that the initial Sync is currently in progress.
