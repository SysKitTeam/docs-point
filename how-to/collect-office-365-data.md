# Collect Office 365 Data

## First Run

After you install and configure SysKit Point, all data for SharePoint Online Sites, Microsoft Teams, Office 365 Groups and Office 365 tenant users begins to load automatically. We will call this process **Sync**, ****since  we sync Office 365 tenant data with data in the SysKit Point database.

When you log in to SysKit Point, you will get an appropriate notification telling you that Sync started.

If you navigate to the Sites screen and drill to Site details of a site for which the sync is not yet finished, a loading screen is displayed and you can notice the animated Sync icon in the top right corner.
