# SysKit Point Quick Start Guide

## Home Screen 

Place where everything in SysKit Point starts. You can see 4 major sections: 

* **Sites** – complete overview and inventory of all sites and ownerships. Full list of classic sites, sites connected to MS Teams and Office 365 groups, and OneDrive as well. 
* **Microsoft Teams & Office 365 Groups** – a complete overview of all Teams and Office 365 groups detected in your environment.

To view specific section, click the appropriate tile.

## Sites Screen



### **What will you see here if you are a Site owner/Administrator?** 

SysKit Point will present you with the inventory of your resources, meaning you will be able to see sites, Teams and Office 365 groups you are the owner of.  

Check for more details about [role based access configuration here](../installation-and-configuration/enable-role-based-access.md). 

## Drill for Details 

Basic principle in the application is, whenever you wish to see more details about specific resource you simply click on its name  to drill deeper. Resources, numbers and details that can be drilled on will be marked with the underline. 

Everything is connected and we made it easy for you to navigate from specific site to the user details and vice versa. 

   
Navigation 

There are multiple ways of navigating through the application. 

* Main Navigation – click on the SysKit orange circle to access main sections of the application. 
* Breadcrumbs – easily detect where you are currently located or move up the hierarchy/back to parent. 
* Drill – clicking on the underlined objects takes you to a more detailed report about that resource. 
* Back Button – takes you to the previous screen, the one that you were at before jumping to a different report.   

Contextual Actions and Reports 

On the right hand side of the screen you will find suggested actions and reports that are connected to the current selection \(site/user\) or report on your screen. 

There are two types of actions/reports: 

* Global Actions/Reports - these actions are always visible and will create report or perform action for the specific site/user you are currently located at.  

For example: If you are exploring in details site called Research and Development, reports on the right hand site will contain information only about that site.
