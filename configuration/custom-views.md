# Custom Views

The Custom Views feature allows you to create and save customized views for your reports in Syskit Point. 

Tailored reports are often needed to accurately track inventory, access, activity or other important information. However, these needs often differ from business to business - what one company finds important another might see as non-essential. 

The ability to save custom views enables you to filter, sort, add, or remove columns in your report based on your specific needs, and then retain those customizations for future use. This includes exporting or scheduling reports with your customized view.


Custom Views can be saved on all overview screens and grid reports, which are the following:

* **Overview Reports**
  * Sites
  * Microsoft Teams
  * Microsoft Groups
  * Users
* **Report center**
  * External Users
  * Orphaned Users
  * Orphaned Workspaces
  * Inactive Workspaces
  * Audit Reports
  * License Reports
  * Sensitivity Labels Reports
  * Storage Reports

## Save Custom Views

This example uses the Sites Oveview report to explain how to save custom views, however the same actions can be performed on any of the above listed reports.

First, you need to customize your report based on your preferences. 

This means that you should:

* Select the colums you want visible from the column chooser
* Organize the columns in the order you want to view the columns 


## Custom Views Options

In the table below, you can find what custom views are saved, and how it impacts the export of the report.
