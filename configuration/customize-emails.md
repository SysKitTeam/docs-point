# Customize E-mails

SysKit Point **allows you to customize e-mails** that will be **sent to site owners** as a part of **Access Review and Lifecycle Management Automation**.

You can customize the following aspects of e-mails:

* **logo**
* **banner**
* **subject**
* **additional message in the body of the e-mail**

These changes can be performed in three locations within SysKit Point Settings:

* **General Settings &gt; E-mail section** 
* **Governance Settings &gt; Access Review** 
* **Governance Settings &gt; Lifecycle Management**

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Please note!**  
Only SysKit Point Admin users can customize e-mails.
{% endhint %}

## E-mail Settings

In E-mail settings, you can define:
    **A global logo** that will be used in all e-mails sent by SysKit Point
    **A global e-mail banner** that will be used in all e-mails sent from SysKit Point

To define a logo used in all e-mails:
* **navigate to the E-mail Settings screen \(1\)**. 
* **Scroll down to see the Customize Logo section**
* **Drag and drop your logo file \(2\)** to define your logo; keep in mind the supported file formats - JPEG and PNG
* **Click Save \(3\)** to save your changes

{% hint style="info" %}
**Hint!**  
**Modifying the logo and banner** as described here **is a global action**, meaning that it **will affect all e-mails**.
{% endhint %}

## Access Review Settings

{% hint style="info" %}
**Hint!**  
Customizing the Access Review e-mail is possible only if the Automated Access Review feature is enabled. For more information on that topic, visit the [following article](../governance-and-automation/permissions-review/enable-permissions-review.md).
{% endhint %}

To customize the Access Review e-mail:

* **Open the Access Review tab \(1\)** in the Governance section of settings 
* **Click the Customize e-mail button \(2\)** to open the editing screen

![Access Review Settings screen](../.gitbook/assets/customize-e-mail_permissions-review-settings-screen.png)

Here, you will see the following sections that can be edited:

* **Subject \(1\)** -  only applies to the Access Review email sent to the owners or administrators
* **Logo \(2\)** - global for all emails
* **Banner image \(3\)** - only applies to the Access email sent to the owners or administrators
* **Custom message \(4\)** - only applies to the Access email sent to the owners or administrators

![Customize Access Review E-mail](../.gitbook/assets/customize-e-mail_customize-permissions-review-e-mail2.png)

The custom message can contain **plain text** or **HTML**. A **link has to be defined in the HTML form** `<a href="URL">LinkDisplayText</a>` where `URL` represents a web address to a web resource, and the `LinkDisplayText` is an arbitrary text that will be displayed in the e-mail and, when clicked, lead to the defined URL.

When done with editing, click the **Confirm button \(5\)** to save your changes.

You can immediately see the e-mail changes by clicking the **Preview e-mail button \(1\)**.

* **Open the Lifecycle Management tab \(1\)** in the Governance section of the settings 
* **Click the Customize e-mail button \(2\)** to open the editing screen

![Lifecycle Management Settings screen](../.gitbook/assets/customize-e-mail_lifecycle-management-settings-screen.png)

Similar to the Access Review e-mail, you can edit the following sections:

* **Subject**
* **Logo**

You can access the e-mail preview by clicking the **Preview e-mail button**.
