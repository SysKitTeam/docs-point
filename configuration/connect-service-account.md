## Connect Service Account

**Service accounts** in SysKit Point are utilized for the Configuration Inventory module, using sensitivity labels for templates and other available features. 

To connect the service account in SysKit Point:
* **Navigate to Settings** > **General** > **Connected Tenant**
* **Switch the Connect Service Account (1) toggle on**

Once the Connect Service Account option is turned on, you can choose how to connect and authenticate your service account.

The two options are the following:

* **Enter credentials (2)** for the service account
* **Multi-factor authentication (3)** with Microsoft Authentication Flow
