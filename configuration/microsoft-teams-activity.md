# Microsoft Teams Activity Tracking

{% hint style="info" %}
**Microsoft Teams Activity Tracking** is available in the Governance plan and higher tiers. See the [pricing page](https://www.syskit.com/products/point/pricing/) for more details.
{% endhint %}

**SysKit Point** enables you to easily **discover which of your Microsoft Teams are not being actively used**.

SysKit Point uses Protected APIs in Microsoft Teams, which make it possible for SysKit Point to **detect inactive Microsoft Teams based on the date of the last message.**

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Please note!**\
SysKit Point **does not require** you to provide access to protected APIs for it to successfully track your Microsoft Teams activity. 
{% endhint %}

To learn more about Protected APIs in Microsoft Teams, read the [following article](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/teams-protected-apis).
