* **Fixed an issue where refreshing the dataset stopped working after the SysKit Point Power BI App upgrade to version 25.** The following error was visible:
`Data source error: Column \'Login Name\' in Table \'Users\' contains a duplicate value \'user_name@contoso.onmicrosoft.com\' and this is not allowed for columns on the one side of a many-to-one relationship or for columns that are used as the primary key of a table.`
