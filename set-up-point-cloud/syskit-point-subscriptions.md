## Reconnect After Purchasing

There are two potential reasons why you may need to reconnect your tenant after purchasing your Syskit Point subscription: 

  * Your **trial has expired, and 21 days after the trial expiration, your Syskit Point instance is deleted**. If you purchased your Syskit Point subscription more than 21 days after the trial expiration, you will **need to reconnect your tenant**.

  * Your **Syskit Point license has expired, and 30 days after the expiration date, your Syskit Point instance is deleted**. When you purchase a Syskit Point subscription again, you will **need to reconnect your tenant**. 

In case your Syskit Point is licensed, but your instance was deleted, you will see a message notifying you of that, as shown below. 

To reconnect your tenant **click the Connect Tenant button (1)**.
