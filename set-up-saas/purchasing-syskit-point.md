# SysKit Point Subscription

If you didn't start your free 21-day trial, take a look at the [**SysKit Point trial article**](trial.md) for details on getting started.  

At any point during the 21 days of the free trial, you can purchase a SysKit Point subscription. 

After your free trial has expired, the account will be frozen, but you will still be able to purchase the SysKit Point subscription for the next 21 days in order to retain your data.
