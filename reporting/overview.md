{% hint style="warning" %}
**Please note!**  
Different reports show different objects to select and different filters to adjust. 
{% endhint %}

In the example given, **the Selection step for the Permissions Matrix report shows Microsoft Teams, Microsoft 365 Groups, OneDrive, and sites to select**. 

On the other hand, if we look at **the User Access Report, it lists all users for selection**. 

Some reports, such as **the External Users report, generate right after clicking the report tile and don't show the Selection step**. 
* Since the selection and filters can differ, reports are further described within the category-specific articles below.
