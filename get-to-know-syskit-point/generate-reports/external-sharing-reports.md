## Sharing Links report

This report helps you identify all the files and folders and their sharing links. 

This way, external users can be located and removed easily.

You can perform these actions:
*	**Remove sharing link**
*	**Remove user access**

An external user can be identified if you look for the color of the user icon. If it's a **green-blue color**, it's an **external user**.
