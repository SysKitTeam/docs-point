# Get to Know Your SysKit Point

SysKit Point provides Microsoft 365 admins, site owners, auditors, and compliance officers with everything they need to **manage and govern** the content they own, along with the ability to automate security tasks. 

This comprehensive tool can **analyze your content, check whether everything is functioning optimally and help you export or schedule reports** with a few simple clicks. 

While there are many valuable features available in SysKit Point, here **we'll share just a few of the most-loved features** to get you started. 

## Generate Reports

With the **one-click report generation**, these detailed insights make it easy to manage your Microsoft 365 environment. You can use Reports to **keep track of inventory, perform cleanup workspaces that are old or no longer needed, use auditing to simplify your access review and much more**. 

SysKit Point reports can be generated from the Reports section on the homescreen or by accessing a specific workspace; in the right sidebar, you will have the option to generate all possible reports for that specific workspace.

Reports come with advanced filtering and **can be exported as PDF or Excel files**. To stay up to date with your reports without having to generate them manually, you can also schedule them for delivery via email.

There are many reports available in SysKit Point, and **the categories that the reports cover** are:

* Permission Reports
* External Sharing
* Audit Logs
* Microsoft Teams & Groups
* Users
* Cleanup and Health Check
* Analytics
* OneDrive
* Licenses
* Power BI


## Users Overview

The Users Overview screen can be accessed from the homepage and **provides detailed insight into everything you need to know about your Microsoft 365 users**. This information can also be exported as PDF and Excel files or scheduled for delivery via email. 

You can also click on a specific user through the Users Overview screen. The user details screen includes details on the following:
 * General information about the user
 * The user's analytics and usage
 * Microsoft Teams and Group Memberships the user is a part of
 * Which workplaces the user has access to 
 * The OneDrive data of the user


## Sites Overview

The Sites overview can also be found directly on the home screen, and **allows you to explore and filter through your sites, Groups, Microsoft Teams and OneDrive**. It's an effective way to stay up to date with your SharePoint activity. Just like the Users Overview, this information can also be exported as PDF and Excel files or scheduled for delivery via email. 

Selecting one or more sites also gives you the ability to **manage different options for the sites with one simple click**. Some of the options include:
 * Managing Policies
 * Adding Owners or Members
 * Removing Owners or Members
 * Changing the Sharing Settings
 * Managing Metadata

Along with this, you can click on a specific site for a more detailed overview of it. Here you'll find information like:

  * General information about the site
  * Overview of the site with a number of users, external users, anonymous links, and unique permissions
  * Content overview, which includes a list of all files included in the site
     * The files listed here can also be drilled for more information
  * Who has permission for the site
  * Analytics and usage for the site


## Create Alerts

The ability to create alerts within SysKit Point **helps you detect any changes in your tenant**. Alerts can be set up for the tenant-level and can be set up to get triggered per site, Team or Group as well as specific users. 

There are many options where creating Alerts can be **powerful tool for staying up to date with your environment**, for example:

 * Notifying owners when new members are added to their team.
 * Staying up to date with any new teams being created or if any resources are deleted
 * Get promptly informed of any harmful activity happening in your tenant 
 * Being notified of a specific user's activity
 * And much more!

 When creating an alert, you'll be able to select who should be notified via email. 


## Assign Users Access to Perform Tasks

Within SysKit Point, administrators have the **option to delegate tasks to business users by assigning those users the roles** of Owners, Site administrators or Collaborators. 

This helps identify who needs to be notified for specific workplace activities and enables the automated usage of Access Review and Lifecycle Management tasks. 

Periodically performing Access Reviews on your workspaces will **ensure your workspaces are secure**. As workspaces often need to be checked at different intervals, depending on the sharing settings for a specific workspace, with SysKit Point, you can **define different policies, assign them to the desired workspaces, and the rest is completely automated**. Based on the policies assigned, SysKit Point will create tasks and send the required emails to owners of the workspaces, who can then easily complete their Access Review tasks. 

Lifecycle Management tasks, on the other hand, can be used to **clean up your environment**, in order to ensure that any unused or old content is archived or deleted.
