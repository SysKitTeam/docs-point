Here, you have to enter your existing Microsoft 365 credentials.

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Please note!**  
When you are signing in for the first time, it is advisable to use Global Administrator credentials and proceed with the [Role-based Access configuration](../configuration/enable-role-based-access.md).
{% endhint %}

After the sign-in, the Syskit Point Home screen opens.

## Home Screen

Place where everything in Syskit Point starts. You can see 4 major sections:

* **Sites** – complete overview and inventory of all sites and ownerships. Full list of classic sites, sites connected to MS Teams and Microsoft 365 Groups, and OneDrive as well. 
* **Microsoft Teams & Microsoft 365 Groups** – a complete overview of all Teams and Microsoft 365 Groups detected in your environment. 
* **Users** – explore all users and see more details about their memberships and permissions they hold across the sites. 
* **Reports** – create security and audit activities across your workspaces.

To view specific section, click the appropriate tile.

## Navigation

There are multiple ways of navigating through the application.

* **Main Navigation (1)** – click the Home orange circle to access the main sections of the application. 
* **Back Button (2)** – takes you to the previous screen, the one that you were at before jumping to a different report. 
* **Breadcrumbs (3)** – easily detect where you are currently located or move up the hierarchy/back to the parent. 
* **Drill (4)** – clicking on the underlined objects takes you to a more detailed report about that workspace.

## Built-in Views

Each overview screen comes with a set of predefined views to help you select the most important information for you. On the left-hand side of the report, click the drop-down menu to select the views you are the most interested in.

## Custom Views

If you are not satisfied with the predefined views, please [let us know](https://feedback.syskit.com/).

As an easy workaround, you can add additional columns on your own with the help of **column chooser (1)**, or **column filter (2)** each column to get the desired results.

## Drill for Details

The basic principle in the application is - whenever you wish to see more details about a specific workspace, you **click the name to drill (1)** deeper. Workspaces, numbers, and details that can be drilled on will be marked with the underline or displayed in bold.

Everything is connected, and we made it accessible for you to navigate from a specific site to the user details and vice versa.

## External Links

Whenever possible, Syskit Point shows you an external link so you can, e.g., quickly open a site in SharePoint Online or send an email to Microsoft 365 Group. **External links (1)** are marked with an icon that suggests you will leave the current context, and to distinguish them from drill links mentioned above, they are colored blue.

## Contextual Actions & Reports

On the right-hand side of the screen, you will find suggested actions and reports that are connected to the current selection \(site/user\) or report on your screen.

There are two types of actions/reports:

* **Global Actions/Reports** - these actions are always visible and will create a report or perform an action for the specific site/user you are currently located at. **Example:** If you are exploring in details site called Research and Development, reports on the right-hand side will contain information only about that site.

![Syskit Point - Global actions on site details screen](../.gitbook/assets/syskit-point-quick-start-guide_syskit-point-global-actions-on-site-details-screen.png)

* **Contextual Actions/Reports** - when you select something on the screen, additional actions and reports may appear. If you choose to create a report/perform an action, they will impact the currently selected object in one of the tiles. **Example:** If you select the Documents library in the Content tile, reports on the right-hand side will be related to that selection only, meaning that they will present information about that selected folder, not the entire site you are currently exploring.

## **What Can a Site Owner See?**

Syskit Point will present you with the inventory of your workspaces, meaning you will be able to see sites, Teams and Microsoft 365 Groups you are the owner/administrator of.

Check the [following link](../configuration/enable-role-based-access.md) for more details about **role-based access configuration**.
