# Manually Request Permissions Review in SysKit Point

**Permissions review**, in the context of Office 365 environment, is an activity where a person responsible for an Office 365 resource - be it Communication site, Microsoft Team, Office 365 Group or OneDrive - checks whether permissions, given to users inside (internal) and outside (external) of company, comply with the organizational rules and guidelines. 

While the Automated Permissions Review was introduced in SysKit Point 14, SysKit Point 15 introduces the Manually Requested Permissions Review.

## Resource Owners Flow 

After the manual permissions review request was sent, resource owner receives an e-mail in their mailbox.

* **select the resource (1)**

The Permission Review details screen opens, where you can perform action, check permission changes, and, in the end, complete the Permissions Review.
Actions and reports available here, are the same as in the Automated Permissions Review tasks. You can find them all described in greater detail [here](../common-tasks/permissions-review.md#permissions-review-task-details). 

If a resource has a Permissions Review active, you can access the Permissions Review details screen from the Overview screeen by clicking the Review Now (1) action link, visible when the resource is selected.

Which will instantly redirect them to Permissions Review details screen.
