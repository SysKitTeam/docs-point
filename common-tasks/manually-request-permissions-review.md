# Manually Request Permissions Review in SysKit Point

**Permissions review**, in the context of the Office 365 environment, is an activity where a person responsible for an Office 365 resource - be it Communication site, Microsoft Team, Office 365 Group, or OneDrive - checks whether permissions, given to users inside \(internal\) and outside \(external\) of company, comply with the organizational rules and guidelines.

While the **Automated Permissions Review** was introduced in SysKit Point 14, SysKit Point 15 brings the **Manually Requested Permissions Review** to the table.

{% hint style="success" %}
Use **Manual Permissions Review** in situations **when you need a fast response on an urgent issue**, such as sudden offboarding of a user, or unauthorized external sharing, where you want a resource to be checked as soon as possible.  
You can also **use the Manual Permissions Review to test and prepare** your users for the **Automated Permissions Review**.

## Resource Owners

After the manual permissions review request was sent, **the resource owners receive a Permissions Review request e-mail** in their mailbox.

Link in the email leads you directly to the Permissions Review task in SysKit Point. Here, you can:

* **select a resource \(1\)**
* **perform the Permissions Review \(2\)**

![Permissions Review task screen](../.gitbook/assets/manually-request-permissions-review_task.png)

The **Permission Review wizard** opens, where you can **perform actions**, **check permission changes**, and, in the end, **complete the Permissions Review** for a resource. Actions and reports available here are the **same as in the Automated Permissions Review** tasks. You can find them all described in greater detail [here](permissions-review.md#permissions-review-task-details).

If a resource has a Permissions Review active, you can access the Permissions Review details screen from the overview screen by clicking the **Review Now \(1\)** action link, visible when the resource is selected.
