# Configure Alerts

**Alerts** feature in SysKit Point **allows you to track many events** that are collected within **Microsoft 365 audit logs**.  

**SysKit Point Admins** and **SysKit Point Collaborators** \(site owners and full control users\) can configure alerts. Point Admins can manage all created alerts regardless of who created them. 

You can enable alerts on the following screens:

* **Sites Overview** 
* **Microsoft Teams & Groups Overview** 
* **Users Overview** 

You can configure alerts on a **global level** of your tenant or individually for a **specific site or user**.

## Tenant wide alerts

These tenant wide alerts can be set on Overview screens - Sites, Microsoft Teams & Groups, Users.

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Please note!** Tenant wide alerts on the **Sites Overview** screen and **Microsoft Teams & Groups Overview** screen are the same because they are focused on sites.
{% endhint %}

For **sites**, there are four alert categories:

* **External Collaboration** 
* **Sharing Activities** 
* **Site Administration Activities** 
* **Microsoft Teams Activities** 

For **users**, there are two alert categories:

* **User Activities** 
* **User & Role Administration Activities** 

## Specific alerts for site or user

Specific alerts for the site or user can also be created. On Overview screens, select one site/user and click on **Configure Alert** action in the side panel. 

For **sites**, there can be a maximum of seven alert categories to choose from, depending on the resource that you selected. These categories are:

* **External Collaboration** 
* **Sharing Activities** 
* **Site Administration Activities** 
* **File & Folder Activities** 
* **SharePoint List Activities** 
* **Microsoft Teams & Groups Membership Changes** 
* **Microsoft Teams Activities** 

For **users**, there is only one alert category **User Activities** with two alerts - **User Logged in**, **User Login Failed**.

## Enabling alerts

In the side panel of the Sites Overview screen, you will notice the link **Configure Tenant Wide Alerts \(1\)**.

A dialog screen will open when you click on it.  

You will see few alert categories on the left side.  

To start editing one alert, switch the state of **toggle button next to the title \(1\)**.  

When you have an active alert already, a **green notification \(2\)** will be present next to the appropriate alert category.

In total, there can be three sections in defining an alert:

* **Notifications \(1\)** 
* **Filters \(2\)** 
* **Event Type \(3\)**
