# Configure Alerts

**Alerts** feature in SysKit Point **allows you to track many events** that are collected within **Microsoft 365 audit logs**.  

**SysKit Point Admins** and **SysKit Point Collaborators** \(site owners and full control users\) can configure alerts. Point Admins can manage all created alerts regardless of who created them. 

You can enable alerts on the following screens:

* **Sites Overview** 
* **Microsoft Teams & Groups Overview** 
* **Users Overview** 

You can configure alerts on a **global level** of your tenant or individually for a **specific site or user**.

## Tenant wide alerts

These tenant wide alerts can be set on Overview screens - Sites, Microsoft Teams & Groups, Users.

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Please note!** Tenant wide alerts on the Sites Overview screen and Microsoft Teams & Groups Overview screen are the same because they are focused on sites.
{% endhint %}

For **sites**, there are four alert categories:

* **External Collaboration** 
* **Sharing Activities** 
* **Site Administration Activities** 
* **Microsoft Teams Activities**
