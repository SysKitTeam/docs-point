# Activate SysKit Point

## Activation

After the purchase of the selected edition of SysKit Point, you will be provided with the license key for the product activation.

At any time, you can log in to SysKit [Customers Portal](https://my.syskit.com/) and navigate to the list of your licensed products. If you do not have the activation information, please [contact us](https://www.syskit.com/company/contact-us).

To **activate your copy of the SysKit Point**, please proceed with the following steps:

1. **Click on the Settings button** and **select the General Settings option** in the drop-down.
2. **Navigate to the License page** and **click the Activate link**
3. **Fill in all the required fields**: name, company, email and the provided license key. 
4. **Click the Activate button** to start the validation process. It only takes 2-5 seconds to perform the activation and it is a one-time-only procedure. If the validation of your email address is successful, an info dialog will appear thanking you for the activation. 

You can check license information and manage it later if you go to Settings &gt; License page.

## Changing the License Key

To change the existing license key with a new one, e.g. when you are upgrading to a different license edition, here are the instructions on how to do so:

1. **Navigate to Settings** &gt; **License**.
2. **Click the Deactivate button**.
3. **Enter the new license key and user details**.

## **Deactivate License**

To deactivate the SysKit Point license, please proceed with the following steps:

1. **Navigate to Settings** &gt; **License**. 
2. **Click the Deactivate button**. 

Once that product license has been deactivated, you won’t be able to log in and access the application until it is activated \(if your trial period has expired\).
