# Licensed Users Count

Using SysKit Point and all of its features, requires having licenses assigned to users in the Microsoft 365 tenant.

 * The price of the SysKit Point subscription **depends on the number of licensed users within the Microsoft 365 tenant connected to SysKit Point**.

**Licensed Users** are all users with any type of Microsoft 365 license attached to them.
 * **Guest Users** only fit into that category **if they have a license assigned to them**. 
   * Having a license assigned to Guest Users is unnecessary for rudimentary use cases such as sharing content and using the Microsoft Teams app.

The number of licensed Users within Syskit Point can be found by going to **Settings > General > Point License > Number of Users M/N**.

 * **M** stands for the **number of licensed users in the tenant** 
 * **N** stands for the **number of Paid users that are included in the SysKit Point license**

If you have Inactive Users, you can remove their license through SysKit Point through the following steps:
 * **On the Home screen, click on Reports (1)**; the Reports site will open with several available options
 * **Scroll to the bottom of the site and select Inactive Licenses (2)**; this will open the report section that will show you all of the licenses that are currently assigned to inactive Users or Guest Users
 * **Select the license of an inactive User (3)**; you can select one or multiple licenses. 
    * To select all inactive licenses at once, press the top checkbox on the left, next to the title 'License.' 
 * **Press the Remove Licenses button (4)**; the button is located on the right side of the screen. 
    * Once selected, a popup will appear. **Type REMOVE and click the Remove button to proceed**.
