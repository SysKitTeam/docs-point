# Power Platform Actions

{% hint style="success" %}
**Power Platform actions** are currently available as a free preview, allowing you to explore its benefits at no cost.
{% endhint %}

Many organizations use Power Platform to build apps, automate workflows, and analyze data. Through Syskit Point, you can generate detailed reports for your Power Platform resources. 

To help you manage these resources, Syskit Point is introducing new Power Platform actions:

* [Change Owners](#change-owners)
* [Add Co-Owners](#add-co-owners)
* [Delete Environment](#delete-environment)

These actions help manage access and reduce the risk of orphaned resources.

* [Take a look at the Power Platform Reports article for more details on all the available Power Platform reports.](../reporting/power-platform-reports.md)

{% hint style="warning" %}

Please note that the Power Platform actions can only be completed by the Syskit Point Global Admins. Â
