# Power Platform Actions

{% hint style="success" %}
**Power Platform actions** are currently available as a free preview, allowing you to explore its benefits at no cost.
{% endhint %}

Many organizations use Power Platform to build apps, automate workflows, and analyze data. Through Syskit Point, you can generate detailed reports for your Power Platform resources. 

To help you manage these resources, Syskit Point is introducing new Power Platform actions:

* [Change Owners](#change-owners)
* [Add Co-Owners](#add-co-owners)
* [Delete Environment](#delete-environment)
* [Delete Flows](#delete-flow)
* [Delete App](#delete-app)

These actions help manage access, resolve the risks of orphaned resources by adding ownership, and eliminate sprawl by removing inactive environments.

* [Take a look at the Power Platform Reports article for more details on all the available Power Platform reports.](../reporting/power-platform-reports.md)

{% hint style="warning" %}
To generate the [Power Platform reports](../configuration/enable-role-based-access.md) and complete the Power Platform actions, please ensure [you have enabled Power Platform data collection](../configuration/power-platform.md).\
Power Platform actions can only be completed by Global Admin users. Â

## Change Owners

The Change Owners action can be completed for Flows on the Power Automate Inventory and Power Automate Permissions reports, as well as for Power Apps on the Power Apps Inventory and Permissions reports. 

{% hint style="warning" %}
Please note that the Change Owner action cannot currently be performed to change the Primary Owner of Flows; only the co-owners can be modified. The Primary Owner selection for Flows is disabled as you cannot modify the Primary Owner on non-solution flows.
