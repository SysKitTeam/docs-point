# System Requirements

## Software

We recommend installing SysKit Point on a Windows Server machine, to allow SysKit Point Service to crawl the environment continuously. 

* **Windows Server 2012 and newer are supported** 
* **Microsoft .NET Framework 4.5 or higher** 

## Hardware

**Hardware requirements highly depend on the Office 365 activity, number of users and the amount of data in your environment.** The larger the environment, the more resources will be required to smoothly run SysKit Point. 

SysKit Point requires a server where SysKit Point will be installed and a SQL server for the database \(for smaller Office 365 environments this can be the same server\). 

Here is the list of recommended hardware requirements based on the size of your environment.

**Please note!**   
****If you do not own On-Premises servers, you can use Azure Virtual Machine with the installed SQL server on it as well. Have in mind the requirements recommendation when creating this virtual machine.
