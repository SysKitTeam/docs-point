# Workspaces Without a Sensitivity Label

Syskit Point provides a predefined **Workspaces Without a Sensitivity Label** that is applied tenant-wide. This policy helps you detect workspaces without a sensitivity label assigned in order to ensure all data is properly classified and protected. 

To edit the policy, navigate to the Policies settings screen and **click the Edit Policy (1)** icon.

You can select between three levels of severity: 

  * High
  * Medium
