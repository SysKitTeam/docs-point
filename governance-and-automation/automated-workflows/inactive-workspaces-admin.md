# Inactive Workspaces

Syskit Point provides a predefined **Inactive Workspaces policy** that is applied tenant-wide. This policy helps you clean up inactive workspaces to save storage space and keep your environment running smoothly. Once an inactive workspace is detected, it is flagged as a vulnerability and can be found in the Security & Compliance dashboard.

To activate the policy, navigate to the Policies settings screen and **click the Edit Policy (1)** icon.

The **Edit Policy** dialog opens where you can:
* **Edit the policy name (1)**
* **Select the severity level (2)** for the policy
* **Select the time period (3)** after which the workspaces are marked as inactive
* **Select the time period (4)** for how long a workspace can be **Kept**
* **Enable Set Naming Rule (5)** by clicking the toggle next to it
  * This lets you **apply the naming rule to your workspaces** to let you know they are archived
  * You can select to:
    * Add Prefix
    * Add Suffix
* **Enable Remove Access (6)** by clicking the toggle next to it
  * Selecting this removes access for members and owners of archived workspaces
  * You can choose to remove access for:
    * Members
    * Owners
* **Select to hide the archived workspace's group (7)** from your organization's global address list
* **Enable Task Delegation (8)** by clicking the toggle next to it
  * **Select the actions that owners can perform when they receive a task (9)**:
    * **Keep**
      * This action is visible by default, and if the workspace is kept, it won't be marked as inactive for the period defined in the first step
    * **Archive**
      * If this action is selected and the workspace is archived, it can still be restored later
    * **Delete**
      * If this action is selected, and a workspace is deleted, it can be restored from the recycle bin within 93 days, after which it is deleted for good
  * **Enter the number of total work days reviewers have to complete the task (10)**:
    * **Click the checkbox if you want a reminder sent (11)** 3 work days before the due date 
  * **Select what Syskit Point should do if owners do not resolve this task until due date (12)**:
    * Perform no action
    * Automatically Archive
    * Automatically Delete
* Click **Finish (13)** once you are done with the policy configuration Â
