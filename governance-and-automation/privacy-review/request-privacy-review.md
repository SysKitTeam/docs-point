# Privacy Review

The Privacy settings for your workspaces play a vital role in maintaining control over sensitive information.

Workspace owners can set the privacy level for their workspace and determine whether the workspace can be accessed company-wide or should be restricted to specific members. 

As projects progress or even shift in scope, these privacy settings can change, and access might need to be extended or reduced. A workspace that was once public for easy collaboration might now contain confidential documents that need restricted access. 

For example, a public workspace used for initial brainstorming that everyone was welcome to participate could later house project blueprints or client contracts, requiring a change to a more private setting. 

By regularly reviewing and updating privacy levels, workspace owners can ensure that sensitive information is safeguarded and only shared with the appropriate individuals, minimizing the risk of privacy breaches.

With the new Ask Owners to Review Privacy action, you can now select workspaces that you want owners to review the privacy level for.
