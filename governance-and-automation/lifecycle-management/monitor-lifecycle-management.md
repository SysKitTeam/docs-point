# Monitor Lifecycle Management Tasks in Syskit Point

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Please note!**  
First, make sure to check how to [enable and configure Lifecycle Management Automation in Syskit Point.](enable-lifecycle-management.md)
{% endhint %}

All **content** and **resources** in your **Microsoft 365** Environment have a certain **lifecycle**, be it the **creation** of the **new** resource, that resource being **used** for collaboration, file sharing, chat, or when a product is retired and when the previously used resource becomes **stale**, **inactive** and **no longer needed**.

That last moment is where **Syskit Point Lifecycle Management** comes to shine. It empowers your **Site Owners** to choose whether they want to **Keep**, **Delete,** or **Archive** their inactive resources.

The lifecycle management in **Syskit Point** can be viewed from **two** different **roles**:

* **Syskit Point Admin user**, as described in this article
* Syskit Point Collaborator user

When working with lifecycle management, Syskit Point Admin users can:

* **define lifecycle management settings**
* **decide which resources are going to be monitored**
* **monitor the progress of lifecycle management tasks**
* **receive a weekly e-mail that summarizes inactive content on their environment**
* **resolve the overdue tasks from Site Owners**

On the other hand, Syskit Point Collaborators can perform lifecycle management actions on resources where they are an owner or admin.

Here, we will describe how a Syskit Point Admin can monitor the progress of ongoing lifecycle management tasks.

## Weekly summary of inactive content

Let’s say that lifecycle management automation was enabled for your Microsoft 365 environment in Syskit Point, every Site Owner received their e-mails and are taking care of their inactive resources. A week has passed and the Syskit Point Admin receives a Weekly summary of inactive content via e-mail with the following information:

* newly detected **inactive resources** \(1\)
* resources that **require** the Syskit Point Admins **attention** \(resources still awaiting a response or ones that might be without owners\) \(2\)

Click the **Discover More** if you wish to see which new resources are now inactive. When logged in to Syskit Point, this link opens the Lifecycle Management Overview screen.

Clicking on **Resolve now** opens the lifecycle management **Awaiting Response** report where you can select the problematic resource \(1\) and decide which action you are going to take with it. \(2\)

{% hint style="info" %}
**Hint**!  
To ensure that every resource has an owner responsible for lifecycle management, always set an active user as an owner for orphaned resources.
{% endhint %}

## Governance – Lifecycle Management

To **track the progress** of the ongoing Lifecycle Management, Syskit Point Admins can **use the Governance screen.** To access it, **click the Governance tile** on the Home screen.

You will be redirected to the **Governance screen**. Under the lifecycle management tab, click the **Overview** \(1\). A **Lifecycle Management Overview** screen appears where you can check:

* **Resources that require your attention** \(orphaned resources\)\(2\)
* See all **inactive resources** in your environment\(3\)
* Check out the graphic overview of the **owners response rate** to their lifecycle management tasks\(4\)
* Graphic overview of **actions performed by owners**\(5\)
* Check the **history** of lifecycle management tasks\(6\)
* Manage **Lifecycle Management settings** for your environment in Syskit Point\(7\)
* Change the **time frame filter** for lifecycle management\(8\)

## Resources that require your attention

When you click to resolve resources that require your attention, you will be redirected to the **Awaiting Response** report where you will find all the resources that require some sort of action. Resources that you find there can be **Orphaned** resources or resources that have **Overdue** tasks.

On the said screen you can choose the resource and perform some actions, be it lifecycle management actions \(**keep**, **archive**, **delete**\) or you can **change** the **owner**/**admin** of the resource.

## See all inactive resources in your environment

When you click the **View All** inactive resources, Syskit Point generates an **Inactive Content** report showing you all the resources in your environment which are inactive, regardless of them being monitored or not by Lifecycle Management.

On the said report you get an option to **Keep, Archive,** or **Delete** any resource there.

## View Lifecycle Management History

If you click the **View History**, **Syskit Point** redirects you to the **Lifecycle Management History** report, where you can see all the lifecycle management tasks that were performed in your environment, you can also:

* **Filter** the report by clicking on the action tiles\(1\)
* See the **status** of a resource and who performed an action on it\(2\)
* Read the **comment** of a user who performed said action on the resource\(3\)

You can also perform the **Restore** action on resources that were **deleted** \(if they haven’t been permanently deleted\) or **archived.**
