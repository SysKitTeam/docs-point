# Set Up Access Requests

{% hint style="warning" %} 
**Access Requests** are available in the Governance plan and higher tiers. See the [pricing page](https://www.syskit.com/products/point/pricing/) for more details.
{% endhint %}

The **Access Requests** feature provides end-users the ability to **request access for specific workspaces** through the Syskit Point Teams app.
The following workspace types are supported:
* **Microsoft Teams**
* **Microsoft 365 groups**
* **SharePoint sites**
* **Distribution lists**
* **Mail-enabled security groups**
* **Security groups**

When the Access Requests policy is assigned to a workspace, the **Ask To Join** action is visible next to the workspace on the **All Workspaces** screen in the Microsoft Teams app.  

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Please note!**  
**For public workspaces**, for example, Microsoft Teams and Microsoft 365 groups with privacy set to public, the **Join action is visible** next to the workspace in the Syskit Point Teams app, and users can join these workspaces without additional approvals.
{% endhint %}
