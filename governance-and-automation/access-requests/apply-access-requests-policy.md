#  Apply Access Requests policy

When an Access Requests policy is created, in order to enforce it for specific workspaces, it needs to be manually applied. 

In the Settings for Syskit Point, go under Governance and select Policies.  

Click the **Manage Policies button (1)** to apply the policy.

  * Selecting one or more workspaces shows the **Manage Policies (2)** option on the right side of the screen under the Manage category
  * **Click Manage Policies (2)**
