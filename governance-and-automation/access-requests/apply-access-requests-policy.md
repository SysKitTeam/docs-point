#  Apply Access Requests policy

When an Access Requests policy is created, in order to enforce it for specific workspaces, it needs to be manually applied. 

In the Settings for Syskit Point, go under Governance and select Policies.  

Click the **Manage Policies button (1)** to apply the policy.

{% hint style="information" %}
The Access Request policy is not automatically applied to workspaces, distribution lists, or security groups. You can either manually apply the policy to workspaces or set up [Rules](../automated-workflows/policy-automation.md) to apply your policies automatically. 
{% endhint %}
