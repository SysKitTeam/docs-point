#  Access Requests Approval

After a user requests access to a workspace, it will need to be approved based on the approval process selected when creating the Access Requests policy.

This can be any of the following:
 * Manager approval
 * Manager and admin approval
 * Admin approval
 * Automatically Approve
 * Owner approval

Or it can be based on a new approval process that was created for the Access Requests policy. 

You can read more about this in the [Create Access Requests policy article](create-access-requests-policy.md).
