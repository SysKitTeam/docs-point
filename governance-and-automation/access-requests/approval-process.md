#  Access Request Approval

After a user requests access to a Workspace, it will need to be approved based on the approval process that was selected when creating the Access Request policy.

This can be any of the following:
 * Manager approval
 * Manager and admin approval
 * Admin approval
 * Automatically Approve
 * Owner approval

Or it can be based on a new approval process that was created for the Access Request policy. 

You can read more about this in the [Create Access Request policy article](../syskit-point-teams-app.md).

## Approving Access Requests for Workspaces

To approve Workspace Access Requests that you have received, complete the following steps:  
 * Open your **Microsoft Teams app** and navigate to the **SysKit Point feature (1)**
