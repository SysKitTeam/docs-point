#  Apply Access Request policy

When an Access Request policy is created, in order to enforce it for specific Workspaces, it needs to be manually applied. 

In the Settings for SysKit Point, go under Governance and select Automated Workflows.  

Click the **Manage Policies button (1)**to apply the policy.

  * Selecting one or more Workspaces shows the **Manage Policies (2)** option on the right side of the screen under the Manage category
  * **Click Manage Policies (2)**
