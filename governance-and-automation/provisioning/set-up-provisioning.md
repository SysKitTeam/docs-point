# Set up Provisioning 

## Admins 

To set up a complete provisioning process that fits your company needs, there are a couple of things that will require your attention: 

1) **Provisioning Templates** – you need to specify which types of workspaces end-users can request. Navigate to the [following article](templates.md) to learn more about templates.

2) **Approval Processes** – define a set of rules each new workspace request needs to go through to be approved. See the [article](approval-processes.md) for more information.

3) **Teams Application** – deploy SysKit Point teams application to request and approve new workspaces. Click [here](../syskit-point-teams-app.md) to find out more.

4) **Microsoft 365 group creation** - by default, all users can create Microsoft 365 groups and the workspaces that rely on groups for access. To limit the creation of workspaces to SysKit Point Teams app only, additional configuration is needed. Learn how to [manage who can create Microsoft 365 groups here](restrict-group-creation.md).
