# Set up Provisioning 

## Admins 

To set up a complete provisioning process that fits your company needs, there are couple of things that will require your attention: 

1) **Provisioning Templates** – you need to specify which types of workspaces end-users can request 

2) **Approval Processes** – define set of rules each new workspace request needs to go through to be approved. See the [article](governance-and-automation\provisioning\approval-processes.md) for more information.

3) **Teams Application** – deploy SysKit Point teams application used for requesting and approving new workspaces. Click [here](governance-and-automation\syskit-point-teams-app.md) to find out more.
