## Request Metadata Review

Once you've [enabled the review option for your chosen metadata](manage-metadata-review.md), you can request a review by going to the **Sites Overview or Teams & Groups Overview**. 

For the sake of this article, we are using the **Teams & Groups Overview** screen. To request a review, complete the following:

* **Select one or more workspaces (1)** where you want the metadata review to be performed
* On the right side of the screen, **click the arrow next to the Manage Metadata action (2)** and **select the Ask Owners (3)** option

![Request Metadata Review - Selection](../../.gitbook/assets/request-metadata-review-selection.png)

The **Ask Owners (1)** pop-up appears, where you can:

* **Click the Select metadata (2)** action, and a dropdown list of all metadata in your environment opens
* **Select the metadata (3)** you want the review performed for
   * If the metadata is a faded gray color and cannot be selected, it means that the administrator did not enable reviews from collaborators for that specific metadata
* Once you've selected the metadata, you can **leave a comment (4)** for the owners 
* **Click the Ask Owners (5)** button to finalize the selection and send the task to the workspace owners

After that, a pop-up confirms that the task has been sent and lets you know that you can **check the newly created tasks by going to the Governance screen, selecting Metadata Review, and clicking Requested Reviews**. 

The History report opens, where you can see what actions the owners performed or even review the metadata yourself.

**Please note the following:**
* Owners will receive a new task and e-mail notification.
* Owners will be able to update the metadata.
* Owners will have **15 days** to complete this task.
* After a **Metadata Review is completed or if it is overdue, administrators receive an e-mail** informing them of that 1 day after completion.
* If you've already requested **specific metadata for selected workspaces**, Syskit Point **won't resend the task** for that specific metadata.
