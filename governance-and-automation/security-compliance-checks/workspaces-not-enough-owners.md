# Workspaces with Not Enough Owners

On the Security & Compliance Checks section dashboard, click the **Workspaces with not enough owners** button to see the report.

The Workspaces with Not Enough Owners screen opens, showing a list of all **workspaces with not enough owners assigned** to them.

Above the report, you can see the number of:
 * All workspaces with a policy violation
 * Microsoft Teams with a policy violation
 * Microsoft Groups with a policy violation

The report itself provides information on:
  * **Workspace (1)** name
  * **Detected (2)** - when the policy violation was detected
  * **Owners (3)** - the number of owners the workspace has
  * **Policy (4)** - the policy assigned to the workspace
  * **Rule (5)** - for the policy applied
  * **Status (6)** - status of the policy violation
  * **Assigned to (7)** - who the policy violation is assigned to for a resolution

Additionally, you can complete the following actions for the policy violation:
  * **Accept risk (8)** - this means you will close the policy violation task without making any changes to the current state of the workspace
  * **Send reminder (9)** - this sends a reminder to the person responsible for resolving this task
  
By **selecting all (10)** or more than one workspace, you can perform the bulk action for **Send reminder (11)** and **Accept risk (12)**.
