# Syskit Point for Collaborators

Syskit Point is a **management and governance platform for Microsoft 365** that makes complex environments simple to manage and secure by collecting and organizing data into easily accessed features that help you control everything with just the click of a button.

As a team and group owner, or manager, Syskit Point helps you:

* [**Manage Access**](manage-workspaces/)
* [**Manage Workspaces**](reporting/)
* [**Generate Reports**](resolve-governance-tasks/)

Along with that, the Syskit Point home page gives you direct access to the following features:

* **Sites** - insight into all of All Sites where you are the owner, and gives you the ability to schedule or export the report along with different actions that can be completed, such as adding new owners or members
* **Microsoft Teams & Groups** – insight into the Teams and Groups where you are the owner, providing the ability to schedule or export the report itself, and directly complete actions such as removing or adding owners and members, configuring alerts, and more
