# New Workspace

If your team or department is **starting a new project that will require collaborating and file-sharing, a new workspace might need to be created.**

With the **Request New Workspace** feature, you can choose which type of workspace to create based on the available templates and once your request is sent, the only thing left is for it to be reviewed and approved by your SysKit Point Administrator.

## Request New Workspace

A new workspace needs to be requested from your Microsoft Teams. 

Complete the following steps to submit your request:

* Open your **Microsoft Teams.** 
* Start the **SysKit Point** app in the left side panel.  
  * If you donâ€™t see the app by default, click the three dots and search for SysKit Point. 
  * Select the SysKit Point app, and it will appear on your Teams side panel. 
  * To have it permanenttly visible, right-click the app icon and select **Pin**.
* Click the **Request Workspace** button, located on the top right.
* Select the **type of workspace** you want to request: **Microsoft Team, Microsoft 365 Group, SharePoint Site**.
* Choose the workspace template that best fits your need from the ones that are available.
