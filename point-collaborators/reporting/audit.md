# Audit Logs Reports

Audit Logs reports provide a **comprehensive view of activities that happen within your workspaces**. They help collaborators, and site owners track user actions in their workspaces, monitor access and security, and ensure compliance with policies. 

You can **utilize audit reports to gain insight into how content and resources within your workspaces are being accessed or modified, identify security breaches, and understand user behavior** within your workspaces.

Let's say you are the site owner of a SharePoint site that is being utilized for a project. Others might need to **access the files and folders** in your SharePoint, but this document library is also where sensitive documents are stored. As the owner, **you want to ensure that only authorized users are accessing these documents and that any unauthorized access attempts are detected**. By regularly generating audit reports, you will stay up to date with who accessed which documents and when, as well as any failed access attempts. This helps you take any necessary actions to protect your workspace promptly and effiecient 

Use the **Audit Logs Reports feature in Syskit Point to quickly detect and troubleshoot potential issues, security breaches, or suspicious behavior** happening in your workspaces.
