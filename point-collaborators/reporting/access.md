# Access Reports

Access reports help you keep **track of who has access to sites** where you are the owner and help **ensure that your workspaces are secure and compliant**. Reviewing access reports lets you identify any users with outdated access or potential security breaches. That way, you can take any needed **actions to protect your workspace** in a timely and efficient manner.

Access reports can also help you **monitor the activities of users that you manage**, which is especially useful when multiple people collaborate on shared documents or projects. You can see who has access to your site and documents when they last accessed them, and if any changes were made.

Use the **Access Reports feature in Syskit Point to track user activities, detect unauthorized access, and maintain the security and compliance of your workspaces**.

[For more details on how to manage access to your workspaces, take a look at this section.](../../governance-and-automation/sensitivity-review/)
