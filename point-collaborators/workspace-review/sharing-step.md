# Sharing Step

The first screen on the Sharing Users step is the task overview. Here, you can find information on what is expected of you for this step:

* You'll be asked to **review what's been shared from your workspace**. 
  * Carefully going through and removing unnecessary access helps keep your data safe. 

* Explanation of how many sections this step has: **Shared with Anyone** and **Shared with People in Your Organization**.

* The **Review button**, which you can click when you're ready to start your review.

After **clicking the Review button**, the first section opens where you can review **Links Shared with Anyone**. On this screen, the following information and actions are available:

* **Name (1)** of the content 
* **Link Type (2)** - the level of sharing given through the link, for example, view-only, password-protected (edit), etc.
* **Expiration Date (3)** - shows when the link is set to expire
* **Sensitivity label (4)** - shows if there is a sensitivity label assigned to the content
* **Recommendation (5)** - this section provides a recommendation from Syskit Point on what actions should be taken if there are any notable recommendations to be made. The following recommendation could be suggested:
   * **Remove Expired Links** - expired sharing links are no longer valid. You can safely remove them to reduce clutter and keep your workspace clean and secure. 
* The **Remove Sharing Link (6)** action
  * Clicking this action opens the Remove Sharing Link modal, where you need to confirm the removal of the sharing link
