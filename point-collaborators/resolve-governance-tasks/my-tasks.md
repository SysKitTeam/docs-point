## My Tasks

The **My Tasks** tile is located on the Home screen, and a notification bubble displays the number of tasks that need to be reviewed.

In this example, it is set to one because a single Access Review task was created by Syskit Point and assigned to you. The **user profile** button shows the same notification bubble.

To view tasks assigned to you, click the **My Tasks tile** on the Home screen or the **My Tasks section** in the user profile menu.

**My Tasks** screen displays the active Access Review task with the most important information:

* **Requested date (1)**
* **Due date (2)**
* **Completion progress (3)**
* **Review button (4)**
* **Task categories (5)**
* **Completed tasks categories (6)**

Click **Review** to continue. The **Access Review Task** screen opens - the same screen that can be accessed from email, as explained in the previous section.

The same can be done for any type of task assigned to you, for example, [lifecycle management](../resolve-governance-tasks/lifecycle-management.md).  

On the screen that opens, click the **link in the Task column** to continue and review a site.
