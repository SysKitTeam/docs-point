# Manage External Sharing 

External Sharing is the **ability to share documents, folders, and sites** with people **outside of your organization**. This can be done through **sharing links or by adding external users** to a Microsoft Teams & Groups or sites.

**Sharing links** allows you to **send a link to a specific document or folder** to someone **outside of your organization**. This gives them access to view or edit the file. 

**External users** are people who are not part of your organization, but who **are granted access to specific resources**, such as a site or a Microsoft Team.

**Managing external sharing** is important for collaborators and owners of workspaces because it **helps to ensure that confidential or sensitive information is not shared with unauthorized individuals**. 

SysKit Point helps you manage external sharing, which means you can easily **control who has access to your organization's data** and **limit the risk of data breaches** or other security issues.
