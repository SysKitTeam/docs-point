# Shadow Users Step

The first screen on the Shadow Users step is the task overview. Here, you can find information on what is expected of you for this step:

* You'll be asked to **review the list of shadow users connected to the workspace**. 
  * Shadow users are users that are not group members, but they have access to some content within your workspace. 

* Explanation of how many sections this step has: **Review All Shadow Users.**

* **Review button** you can click when you're ready to start your review.

After **clicking the Review button**, the Shadow Users Review screen opens. On this screen, the following information and actions are available:

* On the left side, there are two filters you can use to view the list with:
  * **All**
  * **Internal** 

* The columns available are: 
  * **Name** - the name of the shadow user or workspace the shadow user is a part of
  * **Username** - the e-mail for the shadow user or workspace
  * **Department** - the department of the shadow user
  * **Is deleted** - whether the user or workspace is deleted
  * **Recommendation** - this section provides a recommendation from Syskit Point on what actions should be taken if there are any notable recommendations to be made

* **View Access** action
  * Clicking this action opens the Access Details for Everyone except external users screen where you can gain more details on the workspace or shadow user through the following columns:
    * **Name** of the workspace
    * **Access**, shows the type of access given
    * **Details**, shows where the user got the permission from
    * **Given Through**, shows where the permission was given through
    * **Sensitivity label**, shows which sensitivity label, if any, is assigned to the workspace
    * **Remove Access button**, which removes the access for the shadow user

* **Remove from Group** action
  * Clicking this action opens the Remove Group Access modal where you have to confirm the removal of the access for the shadow user

Once you've completed the actions you decide to take, clicking Next take you to the next, [Sharing](sharing-step.md), step.
