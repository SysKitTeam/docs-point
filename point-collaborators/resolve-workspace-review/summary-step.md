# Summary Step

The final step in the Workspace Review Wizard is the Summary step. Here, you'll see an overview of the actions you've taken during the review. The following information is available: 

* At the very top, there's a **filter that lists all the actions you've taken** and the number of times it was taken
  * Clicking an action filters the report to show only information about that action
* **Action** - shows the name of the action taken
* **Performed By** - shows who this action was performed by
* **Performed On** - shows the date when the action was performed
* **Status** - shows whether the action was completed successfully or not
* **Details** - shows any additonal details available regarding the action

* **Clicking the Complete Review** button opens the **Complete Review modal** where you can leave any comments you might have about this Workspace Review. The comments can be seen by Administrators and your co-reviewers. 
  * **Typing CONFIRM and clicking the Complete Review button** finalizes the review process.
