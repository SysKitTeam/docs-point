# Membership Step

The first screen on the Membership step is the task overview. Here, you can find information on what is expected of you for this step:

* You'll be asked to **review the list of users who have access to workspace content**, which is critical to ensure workspace security, maintaining appropriate permissions, and streamline collaboration within the team. 

* Explanation of how many sections this step has: **Review All members.**

* **Review button** you can click when you're ready to start your review.

After clicking the Review button, the Membership Review screen opens. On this screen, the following information and actions are available:

* At the top right corner, there is a **Add Owners/Members button**
  * Clicking this opens the Add Owners/Members dialog where you can add more members or owners to the workspace

* On the left side, there are there filters you can use to view the list with:
  * **All** users 
  * **Owners** only 
  * **Members** only 

* The columns available are: 
  * **Name** - the name of the user
  * **Username** - the e-mail for the user
  * **Role** - the role of the user in the workspace
  * **Last Tenant Logged In** - last date the tenant with the user was logged in
  * **Department** - the department of the user
  * **Recommendation** - this section provides a recommendation from Syskit Point on what actions should be taken if there are any notable recommendations to be made

* **Promote to Owner** action
  * Clicking this action promotes the user from member status to owner status
* **Remove from Group** action
  * Clicking this action removes the user from the workspace
* **Selecting more than one workspace** lets you perform these two actions on multiple workspaces at once


{% hint style="warning" %}
* If the [Minimum Number of Owners](../resolve-governance-tasks/minimum-number-of-owners.md) and/or [Maximum Number of Owners](../resolve-governance-tasks/maximum-number-of-owners.md) policies were assigned as part of the Workspace Review by the Administrator, and a vulnerability on the workspace was detected, you will not be able to move forward without resolving the vulnerability. 
{% endhint %}

Once you've completed the actions you decide to take, clicking Next take you to the next, [Shadow Users](shadow-users-step.md), step.
