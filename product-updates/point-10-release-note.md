## Hello World!

Dear ladies and gentleman, if we could have your attention please - introducing the new, shinny and awesome tool - [**SysKit Point!**](https://syskit.com/products/point) ****You might find it strange that the 1st release is marked with the number 10. The reason lies behind the fact that [**SysKit is celebrating it's 10th birthday**.](https://syskit.com/blog/syskit-celebrates-10-years/)   
SysKit Point comes as a successor to SysKit Security Manager, a product that has given us knowledge and insights used as a foundation in building the next great thing. Other than wisdom, all is new in SysKit Point, so let's get started.

## Web-based Interface

With the new and intuitive web-based interface itâ€™s easier than ever to analyze your content, check if everything is ok, and make reports on the fly. You will first notice this shift when [configuring SysKit Point](../installation-and-configuration/configure-syskit-point.md#web-application-settings), and the second time when your app opens in a browser after the installation! All that is left to do is to **log in with your existing Office 365 user account** \(yes, you read that right\), **and you are ready to go!**

## Simplicity

Drills, breadcrumbs, views, contextual and global actions, filters, and each and every aspect of SysKit Point was redone and **made to simplify navigation in the app**. **Simple as it can possibly be, but flexible enough to do everything you need** was the main thought behind every developed feature.
